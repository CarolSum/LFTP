First, that image was tarnished by \r\n         stories of pirated software, then by stories of viruses and \r\n         most recently the rash of stories involving pedophiles using \r\n         BBSs to further their illegal activity (child pornography).\r\n\r\n              This guide is not intended to be the final word on \r\n         public relations for BBSs.  Someone is always coming up with \r\n         a new idea or putting a new spin on an old o'b"ne.  This is just \r\n         a basic guide with some general rules of thumb you can use to \r\n         enhance the image of your BBS.  Keep in mind that there will \r\n         likely be some things in here that you disagree with.  In \r\n         that case, I'd like you to write to me, state your case, and \r\n         maybe you can persuade me to see things differently.  \r\n\r\n              In addition, I am not an attorney, cannot provide legal \r\n         advice, and this is not intended to be a legal guide.  I \r"b'\n         strongly suggest you hire an attorney familiar with \r\n         Communications Law and First Amendment issues BEFORE you have \r\n         trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                                  \xb3CONTENTS?\n                                  \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n         Who "They" Are.........................................1\r\n              The Public........................................1\r\n              The Media......................'b'...................2\r\n         Finding the Media......................................2\r\n              Newspaper.........................................3\r\n              Television........................................4\r\n              Radio.............................................4\r\n         Your Product...........................................5\r\n              You are the BBS...................................5\r\n              Graphics..........................................6\r\n              Making 'b'Changes....................................7\r\n         Tools of the Trade.....................................7\r\n              Business Cards and Stationary.....................7\r\n              Brochures and Fliers..............................8\r\n              Do it Yourself or Hire Someone....................9\r\n         News Products..........................................10\r\n              News Releases.....................................10\r\n              Public Service Announcements....................'b'..12\r\n              News Conferences..................................13\r\n         Handling the Media.....................................14\r\n         Market Research........................................16\r\n              Creating a Survey.................................16\r\n              Making the Call...................................18\r\n         Crisis Management......................................18\r\n              Friendly Faces....................................19\r\n              First Amendment 'b'at Risk...........................19\r\n         Out of the Box.........................................20\r\n         Final Comments.........................................21\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                               \xb3Who "They" Are?\n                               \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n                                  The Public\r\n\r\n              A Summer 1993 survey by Dell Computer indicated that 55 \r\n    'b'     percent of the public does not take advantage of \r\n         technological advances.  That in itself is the single biggest \r\n         Public Relations problem a Sysop faces.  BBS users, \r\n         obviously, fall somewhere in the remaining 45 percent.  \r\n\r\n              Those who fear technology are the ones that are the most \r\n         difficult to explain electronic communications to.  They may \r\n         see computers as taking over their lives.  There are chips in \r\n         their cars, in their mic'b'rowaves, in their stereos, and in \r\n         their VCRS.  Computers send them their utility bills, credit \r\n         card bills, track their income tax payments, and note when \r\n         their daughter is born.\r\n\r\n              Those in that 55 percent are not necessarily \r\n         technophobic.  Most of them are just technologically \r\n         disinterested.  These are the people that we should be most \r\n         concerned with from a Public Relations standpoint.  What they \r\n         know about computers'b", modems and BBSs comes from the \r\n         mainstream media.  A reporter assigned to a story about BBSs \r\n         may or may not fully understand what they are reporting on.\r\n\r\n              The remaining 45 percent includes you and me, the expert \r\n         user, the average user and the novice user.  This group \r\n         doesn't need quite as much public relations massaging since \r\n         it already knows the benefits of using a modem to connect \r\n         with other people.\r\n\r\n              People t"b'hat were overwhelmed when they first called a \r\n         BBS and decided it was too tough to try again also fall into \r\n         that 45 percent.  They have computers, they may be \r\n         technically adept, they can probably even program a VCR.  But \r\n         the mysteries of 8-N-1 elude them.  In addition, there are \r\n         those who were at one time active in the BBS community, but \r\n         are no longer involved.  Maybe they had a falling out with a \r\n         Sysop or another user.  These are b'b"oth disaffected users\r\n\r\n              There is also the group of people that have modems \r\n         because it came with their computer but they have not used \r\n         it.   Some because they don't know they have one, some \r\n         because they aren't interested in using it.\r\n\r\n              How can you distill all these diverse groups into one \r\n         simple Public Relations campaign?  Simply put, you can't.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"b'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   The Media\r\n\r\n              News can be defined broadly as something that is out of \r\n         the ordinary (such as a murder) or something that is a matter \r\n         of public record (such as a City Council meeting).  \r\n         Generally, though, news is a change in the status quo.\r\n\r\n              Many people get upset over what is perceived as a \r\n         liberal or conservative slant in the news.  Because both \r\n         sides get upset about slanted ne'b'ws, that indicates to me that \r\n         most media coverage is unbiased or at least politically \r\n         moderate.  So-called objective reporting is a relatively \r\n         recent invention.  Before the American Civil War, most \r\n         newspapers were just a cut above political tracts.  But \r\n         journalism history and theory is not our topic.\r\n\r\n              Most stories involving BBSs involve a crime that has \r\n         been committed, usually pirated software, viruses, or \r\n         pornograp'b"hy.  Even though one BBS may be raided for \r\n         improprieties, it reflects poorly on the entire BBS community \r\n         by guilt through association.  This is similar to many \r\n         American's mistrust of all Arabs due to the misdeeds of a \r\n         few, as an example.  It isn't fair, it isn't right, but it's \r\n         The Way Things Are.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                              \xb3Finding the Media?\n                              \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n "b"             The easiest way to find out who you need to talk to or \r\n         write to is by looking in the phone book.  All the TV and \r\n         Radio stations and Newspapers will be listed under those \r\n         categories.  You might want to also look for Magazines and \r\n         News Services.\r\n\r\n              A phone call can uncover a lot of information.  You will \r\n         need the media outlet's voice number, fax number, address and \r\n         the person to talk to or send mailings to.\r\n\r\n       "b'       Your best luck in the Public Relations arena is going to \r\n         be in the local media.  Remember that not all your public \r\n         relations efforts are going to be successful.  For instance, \r\n         most News Releases are thrown in the trash.  But if you keep \r\n         at it your efforts will pay off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Newspaper\r\n\r\n              Because of the ris'b'e of electronic information \r\n         distribution, many people have predicted the demise of \r\n         newspapers.  That\'s unlikely, at least for the next fifty to \r\n         one hundred years.  Yes, readership has declined.  \r\n         Newspapers, though, are chameleons and are able to adapt.  \r\n         Thirty years ago most newspapers looked like the New York \r\n         Times.  Most newspapers now have much more open and \r\n         "friendly" looks.  \r\n\r\n              They are also the most powerful of'b' all the media.  No \r\n         other media shapes and forms public opinion to the degree \r\n         newspapers do.  This is usually because they have larger news \r\n         staffs and much longer traditions than broadcast media.  \r\n         Print also has a permanence that broadcast does not have.    \r\n\r\n              As a Sysop, your Public Relations efforts should start \r\n         with the Editor or City Editor, whichever the case may be.  \r\n         These Editors will assign stories to a reporter.\r\n\r\n   'b'           You may be tempted to change your mailing list to a \r\n         certain reporter.  Although this may seem like a good idea, \r\n         reporters tend to change jobs on a fairly regular basis (this \r\n         is especially the case in broadcast media).  You might opt to \r\n         add a reporter to your list, but make sure you continue to \r\n         send material to the Editor.\r\n\r\n              I do not recommend offering to write a column.  You will \r\n         run out of things to write about much'b' sooner than you think.  \r\n         Not only that, newspapers have access to syndicated columns \r\n         that may not deal specifically with BBSs, but will touch on \r\n         them occasionally.  \r\n\r\n              The opinion page provides several opportunities to get \r\n         your name and the name of your BBS out.  The Letters to the \r\n         Editor section can be quite effective in telling your \r\n         message.  You might even be asked occasionally to write a \r\n         guest opinion.  Use those'b' opportunities whenever possible, \r\n         but be wary of writing too many Letters to the Editor.  If \r\n         they get printed often, you will lose your impact and become \r\n         just another shrill voice on the opinion page.\r\n\r\n              News about computers and computer technology tends to \r\n         become lodged in the Business section of a newspaper.  If \r\n         your paper has one, you need to put the Business Editor on \r\n         your mailing list.\r\n\r\n             Be careful with multip'b'le mailings to newspapers.  If you \r\n         have a News Conference, you could have several people from         \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         one newspaper there.  There are few things that annoy editors \r\n         more than finding out that the paper had "overstaffed" a news \r\n         conference.  It might be wise to note on the announcement the \r\n         departments or individuals that are getting copies.\r\n\r\n\r\n          'b'                        Television\r\n\r\n              Television thrives on good video.  Too often, a story \r\n         with good video will override a good story with no video.  \r\n         That is part of the reason why even though nearly everyone \r\n         watches tv news, hardly anyone trusts it.  Despite that, \r\n         television can get your message across to more people in a \r\n         shorter period of time.\r\n\r\n              Assignment Editors are the people that tell the \r\n         reporters what st'b'ories they will tell that day.  Most of your \r\n         productive work with tv stations will be with the Assignment \r\n         Editor.  Assignment Editors work with the Producer, and both \r\n         are supervised by the News Director.\r\n\r\n              Should you be lucky and they are interested in doing a \r\n         story about the current state of art in BBS technology, \r\n         remember that you need to make yourself visually compelling.  \r\n         Show lots of activity on the screen, blinking on the'b" modem, \r\n         the tangle of wires for the phone lines.  \r\n\r\n              Present yourself as a business professional, even if you \r\n         are operating a one-line, non-commercial system.  That \r\n         doesn't necessarily mean you need to wear a suit and tie, \r\n         although that would be a good idea.\r\n\r\n              BBSs have become the whipping boy of tv news during the \r\n         past year.  Sex and Pornography are probably the topics they \r\n         will be most interested in, especially"b' child pornography.  If \r\n         you are called out of the blue someday by a tv reporter \r\n         wishing to do an interview, those are the likely topics.  Be \r\n         prepared to dodge bullets.  \r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Radio\r\n\r\n              Radio Journalism is a dying art.  There was once a time \r\n         when no radio station would even think of not having a news \r\n         department.  Now many stations have only a morning newsperson \r\n         that rewrites the morning paper, 'b"and they might not have even \r\n         that.  It's very tragic.\r\n\r\n              But there are still a very good number of radio stations \r\n         with active news departments.  For the most part, you will \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         deal directly with the News Director.  Some larger stations \r\n         may also have an Assignments Editor.\r\n\r\n              Radio stations will be looking for stories that can be \r\n        "b' told very quickly and have good "sound."  Normally, a radio \r\n         reporter will simply be seeking an interview.  But there may \r\n         be an occasion in which a reporter is doing a special report \r\n         or a series.  BBSs don\'t really have much sound to record, \r\n         but there is some.  Modem tones, connection alarms, and ANSI \r\n         music are a few.\r\n\r\n              Because the pace of radio news departments is even \r\n         faster than tv, believe it or not, it won\'t be uncommon fo'b'r a \r\n         radio reporter to call on the phone to get a comment on a \r\n         breaking story or even a follow-up on a story idea you may \r\n         have presented them with in some correspondence.\r\n\r\n              If you are contacted on a "slow" news day, you and your \r\n         BBS could be included in a number of radio newscasts.  Even \r\n         in music intensive formats, radio news tends to be listener \r\n         active-- that is listeners pay close attention to the news.\r\n\r\n              News/T'b'alk stations are particularly good targets.  They \r\n         are nearly always looking for good people to interview on the \r\n         air.\r\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                                \xb3Your Product?\n                                \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n                                You are the BBS\r\n\r\n\r\n              First of all, you have to think of your BBS as a \r\n         product.  Whether you have a 32 line commercial BBS, a single \r\n         line hobby board or som'b"ewhere in between, you are selling a \r\n         service.  Just as with any other product, you have to decide \r\n         where and how your public relations efforts should best be \r\n         spent.  Would you sell Lambroghinis in rural Oklahoma?  You \r\n         can try, but you probably wouldn't sell very many.  And what \r\n         happens when your Lambroghini has a major recall?  How would \r\n         you handle the Public Relations crisis?\r\n\r\n              Now may be a good time to look at your BBS and tak"b"e an \r\n         inventory.  If you haven't already done so, print the file \r\n         PRODUCT.TXT included with this package.  It will help you \r\n         take stock of the strengths and weaknesses of your BBS.  \r\n\r\n              PRODUCT.TXT examines the inventory and looks at some of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         the immediate public relations problems that could occur as a \r\n         direct result of the features of your BB"b'S.  Since this file \r\n         goes into depth about particular items on your BBS that may \r\n         cause some Public Relations problems, we won\'t discuss it in \r\n         detail here, but we will touch on some of the same issues.\r\n\r\n              The first and foremost question you should ask yourself \r\n         is "Why should someone call my BBS?"  To answer that \r\n         question, let\'s create two BBSs to use as examples:\r\n\r\n              Beta BBS has message bases, files and a couple games.  \r\n     'b"    Delta BBS has message bases, files and a couple games.  \r\n         Nothing really different here.  The Sysop of Beta BBS is an \r\n         active participant in his BBS in that he writes messages on a \r\n         regular basis.  The Delta BBS Sysop turns up on occasion and \r\n         makes an announcement.  Hmmm.  Looks like Beta has a slight \r\n         edge; the Sysop doesn't seem so unreachable.  There is \r\n         nothing wrong with Delta BBS, but it seems so ordinary.  \r\n         There are hundreds o"b'f other BBSs using the same software in \r\n         the same manner and it appears the Sysop is an out of state \r\n         landlord.  \r\n\r\n              If there is only one weapon I can give you in your \r\n         Public Relations campaign that weapon would be yourself.  You \r\n         must allow your personality to become a part of the BBS.\r\n\r\n              In this manner BBSs are identical to TV News.  They may \r\n         offer the same plate, but the plate is presented a little \r\n         differently.  Yo'b"u might like the person who does the weather \r\n         more than the other station's weatherblond.  That is why you \r\n         watch Eyewitness News instead of The Newscenter or whatever \r\n         the case may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Graphics\r\n\r\n\r\n              Sometimes a subtle change in the graphics scheme can \r\n         make a big difference in how a user perceives your BBS.  If \r\n         you use a lot of bright,garish colors a caller may get the \r\n         impression that the BBS"b" is loud and brash.  Look closely at \r\n         how TV stations use color.  They generally use two or three \r\n         colors to set the overall graphics image and everything else \r\n         is either based on those colors or is worked into them \r\n         somehow.       \r\n\r\n              You should also examine how your menus are laid out.  \r\n         Your first concern should be whether they make sense.  A \r\n         caller shouldn't have to scratch his head trying to figure \r\n         out what he should "b'do next, unless he really has no idea.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Secondly, is the picture busy?  A busy menu page takes \r\n         longer to draw and is harder to read.  If after the screen is \r\n         drawn and you find yourself distracted, chances are your \r\n         layout has too many elements.\r\n\r\n              Graphics artists for print publications talk about what \r\n         is called "white space."  That is'b' the amount of nothingness \r\n         that surrounds text and pictures.  The more there is the more \r\n         pleasing to the eye the page is.  There is nothing wrong with \r\n         using a background to support your menus, but it should be \r\n         unobtrusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Making Changes\r\n\r\n              Whenever you change or add something you need to think \r\n         to yourself "Is this something that my users need or want?"  \r\n         You also need to think of the image yo'b"u want your BBS to \r\n         present.  If you have a Science Fiction themed BBS, that new \r\n         CD-ROM of Civil War statistics may not fit in very well.\r\n\r\n              I want to make the point, though, that you might prefer \r\n         to run a BBS that offers something of interest to everyone.  \r\n         But if you do have a thread that runs throughout the entire \r\n         system you need to think twice before making a change or an \r\n         addition.  If it doesn't feel right to you then it prob"b"ably \r\n         won't be kosher with your users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                             \xb3TOOLS OF THE TRADE?\n                             \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n              You have your computer(s), phone lines(s), software, \r\n         message bases, and file areas.  But do you have your \r\n         stationary and business cards?  Unless you are running a \r\n         commercial system, you probably don't (and many commercial \r\n         systems don't either"b").\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Business Cards and Stationary\r\n\r\n              From time to time you'll want to write a letter as the \r\n         Sysop of your BBS.  This letter may be to a user, your city \r\n         officials, your Congressman or even to local media outlets.  \r\n         Your letter will carry more weight if it is on stationary.  \r\n         Make sure it has the name of your BBS, mailing address, voice \r\n         line and data line.  Your name and title are options since \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        "b"                                                   BBS-PR pg 7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         you will be signing it anyway.\r\n\r\n              If you work as a salesperson, an engineer, or any other \r\n         service oriented business, you wouldn't think twice about \r\n         getting business cards.  They are an essential part of your \r\n         business armament.  You hand them to every new person you \r\n         meet during the course of your day.  You should do the same \r\n         for your BBS.  \r\n\r\n     "b'         Business cards are an effective way of getting the word \r\n         out about your BBS.  You don\'t need anything fancy.  Just the \r\n         name of your BBS, your name, your title, a mailing address, \r\n         your voice line and your data line.\r\n\r\n              As for your title, I would recommend System Operator.  \r\n         The average person on the street, including some who claim to \r\n         be computer literate, may not understand what "Sysop" means.\r\n\r\n              If you have even the s'b'lightest reason to write someone \r\n         on BBS stationary, then you should do it.  Always carry some \r\n         BBS business cards with you and pass them out at every \r\n         opportunity.  Stationary and business cards are inexpensive \r\n         and extremely effective.\r\n\r\n              One word of caution, though.  If your BBS is not \r\n         affiliated with your professional career, you need to make \r\n         sure you keep the two separated.  This can be a problem when \r\n         handing out bus'b'iness cards in particular.  You might be \r\n         tempted to give a client cards from both work and your BBS.  \r\n         Should you do this, the client must be made aware that they \r\n         are two completely separate entities.  Not only that, but \r\n         your boss might not be too keen on the idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Brochures and Fliers\r\n\r\n              Brochures are also good promotional items for BBSs.   \r\n         Although they are not as necessary as business cards and \r\n       'b"  stationary, they can be very good tools.  Brochures can be \r\n         left at computer stores, taken to conventions, or used to \r\n         send in response to advertising.\r\n\r\n              Good brochures don't necessarily have to be \r\n         professionally produced, printed on glossy stock paper and \r\n         using four colors.  You can produce an effective brochure \r\n         using a desktop publishing program at home.  \r\n\r\n              A brochure should hit on the main points you want to \r\n         "b"make, have some graphics, and entice the reader into calling.  \r\n         A brochure is intended to introduce your product to potential \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         callers.  Don't feel you should fill up the entire brochure \r\n         with a lot of copy.  For one thing, if there's a lot to read, \r\n         most of it won't get read unless it is extremely compelling.  \r\n         The majority of the time, though, simple will "b'suffice.\r\n\r\n              When developing your brochure, you should design it by \r\n         cutting the page in thirds and deciding what needs to be on \r\n         which page.  Obviously, you want the name of the BBS, the \r\n         phone number and maybe a graphic on the front.  You get to \r\n         the nitty gritty of what is on your board inside.  The middle \r\n         section of the outside should be left blank so you can put an \r\n         address on it.\r\n\r\n              A flier generally is one page, a'b'nd follows roughly the \r\n         same guidelines as those for a brochure.  In general, though, \r\n         you layout for the entire page instead of in thirds.\r\n\r\n              I mentioned "white space" earlier, and I want to \r\n         emphasize that again, especially in regard to your printed \r\n         materials.  The more white space you have, the more pleasing \r\n         to the eye your layout is.  Of course, that doesn\'t mean have \r\n         a blank page with only one sentence on it.  You do need to \r'b'\n         keep your pages from looking cluttered and busy.\r\n\r\n                                Do it yourself\r\n                                      or\r\n                                 hire someone\r\n\r\n              Personal computers have liberated us to do work \r\n         ourselves that we would previously have hired someone to do.  \r\n         That includes personal publishing.

For roughly b's used to help identify \r\n         your BBS you should use it.\r\n\r\n              Colored paper and spot color can be very effective.  But \r\n         you need to be very careful.  Your information can be hard to \r\n         read on dark paper.  Spot color is exactly that-- a small \r\n         touch of color to highlight something on the page.  But it \r\n         can be put in the wrong place.\r\n\r\n              A couple things to note about having your work done \r\n         professionally:  colored paper and spot c'b'olor usually cost \r\n         extra.  The printshop will also likely charge you to have a \r\n         graphic scanned and placed on your stationary or business \r\n         cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n::::::::::::::\nbbs-pr2.txt\n::::::::::::::\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                                \xb3News Products?\n                                \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n                                 News Releases\r\n\r\n              News Releases can be among the most effective tools you \r\n         use in you'b'r public relations efforts.  This may seem hard to \r\n         believe, but much of what we read, hear or see in the news is \r\n         prompted by a news release.  The News Media really does want \r\n         to know what is going on in the community and News Releases \r\n         provide valuable tip-offs for stories.\r\n\r\n              Among other things, News Releases can be used to make \r\n         yourself "The Expert" in the field.  There is much attention \r\n         being paid in Washington D.C. to the Nati'b'onal Data Highway.  \r\n         By making yourself the expert in computer communications, \r\n         local media might contact you for local reaction to a story \r\n         about the National Data Highway or other topics, including \r\n         computer pornography.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              On any given day, a news department can receive dozens \r\n         of News Releases.  If you send a News Release to a Newspaper, \r\n'b"         or Radio or TV station, don't assume it will be used.  Lack \r\n         of a local angle, lack of timeliness, and obvious business \r\n         promotion are among the reasons most are thrown away.  The \r\n         biggest portion of those that are thrown out, though, are \r\n         News Releases that are poorly written.\r\n\r\n    \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n    ?

Those are also essential to a News Release.\r\n\r\n              You should also strive for clarity and brevity.  Even if \r\n         you consider yourself a poor writer, if you include all of \r\n         these factors, your News Release will probab'b"ly be at the very \r\n         least readable.\r\n\r\n              A News Release should have a Headline, a release date \r\n         (even if all it says is FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE), and contact \r\n         information in addition to the news itself.  Put the news \r\n         release on your BBS stationary and include a business card.  \r\n         Even if your News Release is thrown away, the business card \r\n         might be put into someone's rolodex.\r\n\r\n              Focus on your information.  What exactly is it y"b'ou want \r\n         to convey?  The best news releases usually have one specific \r\n         point to make and everything else supports that one point.  \r\n         Think logically.  Your first paragraph, or the lead to use \r\n         journalistic jargon, should make your point clear.  The \r\n         second paragraph should have more information that supports \r\n         the first, the third should support the second and first, so \r\n         on and so on.  \r\n\r\n              Write simply.  Don\'t use "big" words 'b"unless you \r\n         absolutely have to.  They won't impress anyone.  You should \r\n         also write short simple sentences.  Long complex sentences \r\n         are harder to read.  Newspapers are written at an eighth \r\n         grade reading level.  Broadcasters have only one chance to \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         make the listener/viewer understand the story.  If you have \r\n         the media confused you will be ignored"b'.\r\n\r\n              Avoid the use of computer, modem or telecommunications \r\n         jargon.  Jargon that is used should be explained in simple \r\n         terms.  For instance: "GIFs are pictures that can be viewed \r\n         on a computer screen."  That may be oversimplified, but it \r\n         works.\r\n\r\n              One page is usually sufficient for a News Release.  Two \r\n         pages are acceptable, but more than that is pushing the \r\n         patience of the person you sent it to.  However, if you ha'b've \r\n         material to support your News Release, such as a graph or a \r\n         table, include that also.  If they want more information they \r\n         will call you.\r\n\r\n              Even if your News Release does not become recycling \r\n         fodder, it may not be used immediately.  It may be put into a \r\n         file for future use.  \r\n\r\n              The file PR-SAMP.TXT includes sample news releases along \r\n         with explanations of how and why they were written.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     'b'    Public Service Announcements\r\n\r\n              Radio and TV stations devote some programming time to \r\n         Public Service Announcements, or P.S.A.s.  Newspapers may not \r\n         call them that, but they run them as well.  These are a bit \r\n         trickier to write than a News Release mainly because there \r\n         are fairly strict rules concerning what is or is not a PSA.\r\n\r\n         The litmus tests for a PSA are:\r\n\r\n         1.  Is the group mentioned a profit organization?\r\n\r\n         2.  I'b's the topic of the PSA controversial?\r\n\r\n         3.  Is the group mentioned controversial?\r\n\r\n         4.  Will the reader/listener/viewer feel they are hearing an \r\n         ad as opposed to a PSA?\r\n\r\n              If the answer to any of those is "yes" that doesn\'t \r\n         necessarily mean it is not a PSA.  Chances are, though, it \r\n         won\'t qualify.\r\n\r\n              PSAs have much in common with News Releases in that they \r\n         will include Who, What, When, and Where, but might not have a 'b'\r\n         Why.  If there is a cost involved, that needs to be included \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         as well.\r\n\r\n              PSAs will normally be sent to the PSA Director at Radio \r\n         and TV stations.  PSAs sent to Newspapers can usually be sent \r\n         to the Editor, who will know which department to send it to.\r\n\r\n              Many PSAs can be sent on a postcard.  The file PR- \r\n         SAMP.TXT has a sample'b" PSA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               News Conferences\r\n\r\n              My first thought on holding a News Conference is not to \r\n         hold one.  Unless you have something of extreme importance or \r\n         of a compelling nature, a News Conference probably won't be \r\n         necessary.\r\n\r\n              There are only two reasons I can think of for a BBS to \r\n         hold a News Conference.  One is when a BBS is launched, but \r\n         even that is of marginal news value. The other is Crisis \r\n "b'        Management.\r\n\r\n              Whichever the case may be, you need to be fully \r\n         prepared.  Have copies of your statement and support \r\n         materials available to distribute to members of the media \r\n         that attend.\r\n\r\n              If I am hesitant to recommend a News Conference, I am \r\n         adamantly against a Sysop holding a question and answer \r\n         session only.  If you have a News Conference, you had better \r\n         have something specific to say or you are going t'b'o alienate \r\n         those attending.  \r\n\r\n              Although it is acceptable to read directly from your \r\n         printed statement during your News Conference, you need to \r\n         practice it several times beforehand so you are completely \r\n         familiar with it.  You might even want to practice the entire \r\n         News Conference.  This can be accomplished by having some \r\n         friends or business associates listen to your statement and \r\n         grill you afterword.  Chances are man'b'y of the same questions \r\n         a reporter will ask will be asked by this "practice group."\r\n\r\n              Why do you need to answer questions following your \r\n         statement?  There may be something in your statement that was \r\n         unclear, or maybe needed to be expanded.  Sometimes you might \r\n         even be asked to repeat certain sections.  But when things \r\n         appear to be slowing down, don\'t be afraid to call an end to \r\n         the News Conference.  Make yourself available for 'b"individual \r\n         interviews following the News Conference.  TV or radio \r\n         stations might want a more intimate sounding discussion of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 13\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         what the News Conference was about instead of the formal \r\n         statement.  A reporter might have a question he/she didn't \r\n         want to ask in a group setting.\r\n\r\n              Your News Conference will be competing with all the \r\n         ot"b"her news events going on throughout the day.  Don't waste \r\n         time and don't expect everyone invited to attend.  I've found \r\n         early afternoon or mid morning to be the best times to hold \r\n         News Conferences.\r\n\r\n              News Conferences can be a very productive method of \r\n         getting your message across.  But they are also quite \r\n         misused.  Hold a News Conference only if you feel the need is \r\n         absolutely imperative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4"b'\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                             \xb3Handling the Media?\n                             \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n              Timeliness is a very important factor when sending \r\n         material to the media.  \r\n\r\n              Most News Releases that are not dated can be mailed at \r\n         any time.  If they are going to be for release on a specific \r\n         date, they should be mailed one to two weeks before the date.  \r\n         Public Service Announcements and Event Schedules should be 'b"\r\n         sent two to four weeks before the event.\r\n\r\n              This gives the media plenty of time to schedule \r\n         reporters and other resources.\r\n\r\n              I do not recommend calling an Editor or reporter asking \r\n         when your News Release or PSA will be published or aired.  \r\n         They might consider this badgering.  However, you might call \r\n         and ask if they received it and had any questions.  That \r\n         doesn't guarantee that it will be used, but it might increa"b'se \r\n         its chances, and you might even find out when it would be \r\n         used.\r\n\r\n              The Media is not the enemy.  When you are talking with a \r\n         reporter or a group of reporters there is no need to be \r\n         nervous.  Be friendly but professional.  Treat them as you \r\n         would your co-workers.\r\n\r\n              Generally, be calm but assertive.  You have the \r\n         information they want.  Because computer communications is \r\n         still a burgeoning field, report'b"ers may ask what you think \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 14\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         are dumb or inconsequential questions.  Just answer them \r\n         patiently.  Offer information you think is pertinent to the \r\n         issue.  The more facts they have the more accurate the story \r\n         will be.\r\n\r\n              If you read, see or hear a news story that you feel was \r\n         unfair in its coverage of the BBS Community, don't be afraid \r\n     "b"    to call or write the Editor or News Director and complain \r\n         about it.  Don't be angry, but point out what you feel was \r\n         unfair.  The worst thing you can do is get into an argument \r\n         with a member of the media.  Any headway you've made \r\n         previously can be destroyed.  You are more likely to be \r\n         listened to by being candid but keeping your head on your \r\n         shoulders.  They might make a retraction to the offending \r\n         story or offer you the opport"b"unity to set the record \r\n         straight.  If nothing else, you got it off your chest.\r\n\r\n              Video cameras are so ubiquitous these days that you \r\n         shouldn't give them a second thought.  You should be aware of \r\n         their presence though.  A dark sport jacket with a light \r\n         colored shirt works best on camera.  Flashy or very colorful \r\n         clothes can be very distracting.  The viewer might pay more \r\n         attention to what you are wearing than what you are saying"b".\r\n\r\n              Never, ever, at any time knowingly tell a falsehood.  \r\n         You'll be caught and you'll be hung out to dry.  If you say \r\n         something that later turns out to be incorrect, then you can \r\n         honestly admit your mistake.  In addition, if there is \r\n         something you don't know, admit that also.  It's always \r\n         better to admit a lack of knowledge than it is to dance \r\n         around a question with a pseudo-answer.  You can always look \r\n         up the correc"b't answer and call the reporter later.\r\n\r\n              Drawing on that same theme, if you have gotten into a \r\n         situation in which you feel you have gotten in over your \r\n         head, defer the issue to someone you feel comfortable has the \r\n         proper skills and knowledge.  In most cases, a reporter will \r\n         accept your suggested replacement.  The only time it might \r\n         not work is when the reporter is asking about something that \r\n         directly impacts you or your BBS.  \r\n'b'\r\n              This may seem obvious, but you should return calls \r\n         promptly.  Reporters are always under some sort of deadline \r\n         pressure.  The sooner you can return their calls, the more \r\n         they will appreciate you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 15\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                               \xb3Market Research?\n                               \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n     'b"         Who needs to do Market Research?  You do.  The days of \r\n         opening up a BBS with a few file areas and some message bases \r\n         are numbered.  Successful BBSs will be those that plan \r\n         carefully with an eye toward what users really want-- not the \r\n         desires of the noisy few.\r\n\r\n              While online questionnaires are quite useful, they often \r\n         don't go far enough or have a large enough base for you to \r\n         make long term decisions.  The biggest probl"b"ems are low \r\n         response rates and questions that answer themselves.  Very few \r\n         online surveys that I've seen provide enough qualitative \r\n         information for anything other than short term planning.\r\n\r\n              If you are planning on pulling in some new message \r\n         bases, but want to know which ones will actually be read by \r\n         users, then online questionnaires are quite sufficient for the \r\n         job.  But if you plan on opening a new BBS, a major change in \r\n  "b'       image or thrust, or becoming a larger player in the BBS \r\n         community you probably need to do more than question your \r\n         active users.\r\n\r\n              But there are still times in which you must simply go \r\n         with your visceral instincts.  If you have just done the most \r\n         extensive survey in the history of the industry, you may just \r\n         have to do what your gut tells you to do, even if it is in \r\n         total disagreement with what the research says you should'b" do.\r\n\r\n              The easiest, least expensive, and probably the most \r\n         effective research for BBSs to do is call-out research.  Pick \r\n         up the phone and start dialing.  But you must have a method.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Creating a Survey\r\n\r\n              Depending on what you want to find out, you'll want to \r\n         angle your research in different directions.  A person \r\n         setting up a new BBS is going to need information different \r\n         from that an establ"b"ished Sysop would need to consider whether \r\n         to expand or add services.\r\n\r\n              For our purposes, let's assume you want to do some basic \r\n         research on the group of people that use modems.  To make \r\n         things as easy as possible, we'll assume you will be \r\n         conducting 100 surveys.  This does NOT include people who \r\n         hang up on you or you terminate because they do not fit the \r\n         demographic profile you are looking for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     "b"                                     BBS-PR pg 16\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              The first thing you'll need to determine is the \r\n         demographic breakdown in your community as a whole.  What is \r\n         the percentage of men and women and their age groups?  This \r\n         information can easily be found at your local library.  Use \r\n         the most recent census data available.  Take those \r\n         percentages in each age/sex demo and conduct the same number \r\n         of surveys (23% wome"b"n aged 25 to 32 in your community, then \r\n         23 surveys with women in that age group).\r\n\r\n              The first thing you need in the survey is a set of \r\n         Terminal questions.  These questions help you determine the \r\n         age and sex groups you need, whether they own computers, \r\n         whether they own modems and how often they use modems.  If \r\n         they don't answer any of the questions in the appropriate \r\n         manner, you break off the interview.  These people are NOT \r\n "b'        included as part of your 100 completed surveys.\r\n\r\n              If you want an overview of the BBS community compared to \r\n         the community as a whole, you will need to keep track of the \r\n         people that are terminated.\r\n\r\n              Since we are developing a profile on the modem using \r\n         public in your community, we need a set of questions to \r\n         determine how often they use them and in what manner.  We \r\n         then need some questions to find out what services the'b'y use, \r\n         what activities they participate in, and what they might see \r\n         as any shortcomings. \r\n\r\n         Finally, some questions on their hardware and software.\r\n\r\n              All these numbers can be inserted into a spreadsheet \r\n         program.  From there you can make pie charts or bar graphs to \r\n         represent just about anything and help you make planning \r\n         decisions.\r\n\r\n         There is a sample survey in the BBS-SAMP.TXT file.\r\n\r\n              Here are some terms'b' that are in the sample survey that \r\n         you might want to know:\r\n\r\n              PROMPT-- Ask about listed items.  Subject may offer one \r\n         or more.\r\n              QUERY-- Ask for more, do NOT specify.  Ask "Anything \r\n         else?" and write down responses\r\n              (see XX)-- Depending on response to a question, then go \r\n         to the question with that number (eg: see 5B)\r\n              SPECIFY-- Subject may offer an answer.  If not, ask.\r\n              TERMINATE-- Bring to an en'b"d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Making the Call\r\n\r\n              You don't need to buy a list in order to make call out \r\n         research.  All it takes is a phone book or city directory.  \r\n         City directories are helpful in that they will have phone \r\n         numbers and addresses that may not be in the phone book.  \r\n         City directories are also expensive, especially when compared "b'\r\n         to that phone book you received when you ordered a phone \r\n         line.\r\n\r\n              Starting with the first residential listing, keep \r\n         dialing down the column until you are able to get a completed \r\n         survey.  Skip the rest of that column, next column and start \r\n         at the top of the following.\r\n\r\n              For example, if you have a three column phone book (most \r\n         are), you get a completed survey on the tenth call in the \r\n         second column.  Skip 'b'the remainder of the second column, skip \r\n         the third column, and then start again at the top of the \r\n         first column on the second page.  This will give you a fairly \r\n         random sample.\r\n\r\n              Also make sure you do not purposely call business \r\n         numbers.  Businesses get irritated when people make \r\n         unsolicited calls.  Many individuals do as well.  Expect a \r\n         lot of people to hang up on you.\r\n\r\n              ALWAYS thank the person at the end of the i'b'nterview, \r\n         even if you terminate them after the first question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                              \xb3Crisis Management?\n                              \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n              The first thing to remember about Crisis Management is \r\n         to avoid creating one.  That isn\'t always possible.  In that \r\n         case, the second thing to remember is "Don\'t Panic."  You \r\n         simply don\'t have time.  Always keep your head.\r\n\r\n       'b"       It's quite unlikely BBSs will be responsible for \r\n         volcanic eruptions or toxic waste dumps.  Most crisis a BBS \r\n         would be involved in are legal in nature.  If that's the \r\n         case, you'll need to contact your attorney at once.\r\n\r\n              In fact, you might even want to consider keeping one on \r\n         retainer or having a pre-paid legal plan.  Your attorney \r\n         should be familiar with communications law and First \r\n         Amendment Issues.  Your local Bar Asso"b'ciation should be able \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 18\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         to help you find one.\r\n\r\n              The media has easier access to prosecutors than to \r\n         defendants.  That is why in most criminal cases it appears a \r\n         suspect has already been convicted and hauled off even though \r\n         the case has not yet been brought to trial.  The good news is \r\n         that more defense attorneys are becoming media savvy and 'b"are \r\n         willing to make statements to reporters.\r\n\r\n              Most of the time, the best thing to do is to let your \r\n         attorney do your talking for you.  Among other things, that's \r\n         what you are paying him for.  He will know what can and \r\n         cannot be said in public and is in a better position to deal \r\n         with legal intricacies that may come up.\r\n\r\n              For now, the online community tends to rally around BBS \r\n         operators who have been accused of im"b'proprieties.  Unless \r\n         your counselor objects, you can begin drumming up support \r\n         from within the industry.  Among other things, you can make \r\n         legal documents available in computer readable form.  Contact \r\n         industry magazines such as BOARDWATCH, BBS CALLERS DIGEST and \r\n         CONNECT and let them know what is happening.  But you should \r\n         always advise or consult your attorney before doing any of \r\n         this.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Friendly 'b"Faces\r\n\r\n              I've made this point before and I'll make it again.  \r\n         Reporters assigned to cover a story involving BBSs or other \r\n         online services may not fully understand the industry.  Some \r\n         of them may even be technophobes.\r\n\r\n              With that in mind, there is another position you can \r\n         work yourself into.  That is the position of the Local \r\n         Expert.  For sake of example, another Sysop has run into \r\n         trouble with the law.  You could "b'make yourself available to \r\n         help explain what some of those complicated technological \r\n         terms are all about, making sure you stay clear of the legal \r\n         issues involved.  You may not get your face on TV or your \r\n         name printed in the paper, but you will be providing a \r\n         valuable service to your local media.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              The First Amendment\r\n                                    at Risk\r\n\r\n              The online community is under attack.  Ther'b"e are many \r\n         in government who apparently believe First Amendment freedoms \r\n         should not be extended to BBSs and other online services, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 19\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         even if they don't explicitly state this.

"Heh!" t'b'hey think, "this new door game will \r\n         bring me a few more callers!"\r\n\r\n              Wrong.\r\n\r\n              You can be assured that new game is A) already on \r\n         another BBS in town, B) the potential new callers won\'t know \r\n         for sometime that you have it or C) potential new callers \r\n         won\'t care that you have it.\r\n\r\n              The game can wait \'til tomorrow.  Do something that is \r\n         more likely to bring in potential callers to your BBS in \r\n         particular a'b"nd into the BBS community generally.  Get out of \r\n         the house.\r\n\r\n              Chances are your BBS or the local BBS or Sysops' \r\n         Association sponsors a picnic or some such at least once a \r\n         year.  Although this is a good idea, it usually is a \r\n         gathering a modem users.  You need to become more involved \r\n         with the community as a whole.\r\n\r\n              There are many, many opportunities to create a good \r\n         public relations image within the community.  Eve"b'n though the \r\n         mainstream media should be a part of your public relations \r\n         efforts, you do not have to rely on them to tell your \r\n         message.\r\n\r\n              Your local Chamber of Commerce probably has some sort of \r\n         monthly or annual list of events going on in the community.  \r\n         There should be several that you can attend or co-sponsor on \r\n         behalf of the BBS.  You can also make yourself available to \r\n         talk to Service Clubs and Youth Groups.\r\n\r\n\r'b"\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Have you thought of conducting a seminar?  Let's face \r\n         it, BBSs are not among the easiest computer applications to \r\n         use.  You could teach users and potential users about \r\n         telecommunications and BBSing.  With more and more BBSs \r\n         connecting to the Internet, a seminar on how to use the \r\n         Internet could be quite valuable.  As an aside, you might \r\n  "b"       even be able to bring in a few bucks by conducting seminars.\r\n\r\n              Schools are another place to make your mark.  Donate \r\n         your time to teach a class or be a guest in a class.  You \r\n         might even consider donating your old equipment to an \r\n         elementary school when you upgrade to newer equipment.  That \r\n         might even bring you some good press coverage.\r\n\r\n              If you have a laptop or an older computer you wouldn't \r\n         mind toting around, take it"b' with you with a scaled down \r\n         version of your BBS to show people what it looks like.  Very \r\n         few things work better than a good visual aid.  \r\n\r\n              If you produce a newsletter for your BBS that is mailed \r\n         to users on a regular basis, add the local media outlets to \r\n         your mailing list.  Just as with News Releases, most \r\n         newsletters will be thrown out.  But sometimes someone will \r\n         grab an idea from one and produce a story from it.  By golly,'b" \r\n         you'll probably be the first person they call.\r\n\r\n              Everyday thousands of cars go past yours or you pass \r\n         them.  Bumper stickers are moving billboards.  Make them \r\n         available anytime you are out meeting the public.  Because \r\n         you must make a quick impression, just have the name of your \r\n         BBS and the data phone number printed on them.\r\n\r\n              Coffee mugs and t-shirts are good promotional items that \r\n         can also bring in some money.

The Internet is a worldwide \r\n         network connecting Universities, Research Centers, Government \r\n         and Business with electronic mail, news, public message \r\n         bases, and computer programs.\r\n\r\n              This is the first time the Internet has been publicly \r\n         available in the Fort Smith area.

It also provides a "warm \r\n         body" with a quot'b'e, and how to contact the "warm body."\r\n\r\n              This is also an example of a "hard news" type of news \r\n         release.  It states the facts with few embellishments.  The \r\n         next news release is a bit more complicated since it starts \r\n         with a softer lead, or beginning.

The Internet is, if not the largest, one the \r\n         largest computer oceans.\r\n\r\n              Apheli'b'on Computer Bulletin Board System is sponsoring a \r\n         seminar designed to help computer users learn to navigate \r\n         through the Internet.  "This seminar will focus on Electronic \r\n         mail addressing and file transfers," according to System \r\n         Operator Robert Parson.  More seminars dealing with other \r\n         aspects of the Internet are planned.\r\n\r\n              The Seminar will be held Saturday, October 9 at 1:00p.m. \r\n         at the Fort Smith Public Library.

The \r\n         charge for the seminar was included since it was necessary, \r\n         but it was buried deep in the news release.\r\n\r\n              If you'll notice, both of these news releases have a \r\n         c"b"ontact name and number.

But as the raid proved, I was apparently \r\n         wrong.\r\n\r\n              Yes, the PFLRM is working toward separation from the \r\n         Nation of Cellophane Tape.  The People's Front, though, \r\n         should have the opportunity to have its opinions and vie"b'ws \r\n         out in the open as any political party does.  \r\n\r\n              As the System Operator, I have always encouraged freedom \r\n         of speech, no matter what form that speech takes.  There have \r\n         been times in which some users have left messages I felt were \r\n         not just politically incorrect but downright vile.

Whether you \r\n         have a 32 line commercial BBS, a single line hobby board or \r\n         somewhere in between, you are selling a service.  Just as \r\n         with any other product, you have to decide where and how your \r\n         public relations effor'b"ts should best be spent.  \r\n\r\n              Now may be a good time to look at your BBS and take an \r\n         inventory.  The Inventory included at the beginning of this \r\n         file will help you take stock of the strengths and weaknesses \r\n         of your BBS.  Some of these things you may already have \r\n         thought of.  Others possibly not.  Whatever the case may be, \r\n         this is a very subjective matter and there are no right or \r\n         wrong answers.\r\n\r\n              We'll take this s"b'tep by step and briefly examine some of \r\n         the immediate public relations problems your BBS may present \r\n         and some ways to solve those problems.\r\n\r\n              I want you to bear in mind that it is NOT my intention \r\n         to tell you how to run your BBS.  In addition, I don\'t think \r\n         there are any "bad" features for a BBS, except of course \r\n         those that are patently illegal.  If anything like that is \r\n         implied, it wasn\'t intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n         BBS NAME:\r\n\r\n 'b'             The name of your BBS should be chosen very carefully and \r\n         it should be in keeping with the overall tone of the BBS.  \r\n         Chances are you wouldn\'t want to call your BBS "Thunder of \r\n         Cloven Hooves" if the emphasis is on scholarly Biblical \r\n         discussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Sysop:\r\n\r\n              If you are known to users mainly as the Sysop, that \r\n         could be creating an aloof image.  That could be the image \r\n         you want.  On some larger boards with st'b"affs that may be the \r\n         best way to handle administrative duties.  But if you want to \r\n         have a more folksy and personable board you need to make \r\n         yourself known.  Create an account with your name, if you \r\n         haven't already done so.  Encourage users to refer to you \r\n         with your name, instead of The Sysop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    YOUR PRODUCT pg 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    General Interest/Special Focus\r\n\r\n   "b'           You may want to have a BBS with a little bit of \r\n         everything for everybody.  Even with cable becoming more \r\n         prevalent, the three major broadcast networks still have the \r\n         largest viewership.  A General Interest BBS with a very large \r\n         plate to offer will draw users but could overwhelm some \r\n         users, especially new users.  \r\n\r\n              A BBS with a specific interest runs the risk of being \r\n         too narrowly defined.  There is probably a market'b" for a BBS \r\n         about horse racing jockeys six feet and taller with green \r\n         eyes, but it's also so specialized it would attract few \r\n         callers (if any).\r\n\r\n\r\n         Users\r\n\r\n              Most BBS have very large user lists.  Many of those \r\n         lists are bogus in that they reflect all the people that have \r\n         visited since the BBS was established.  Some Sysops routinely \r\n         clean the chaff out of the user lists.  This is a good idea \r\n         in that it makes it"b" easier for Sysops to keep track of who is \r\n         active and who is not.  In addition it helps users who log in \r\n         only occasionally.  If a user hasn't logged on recently he \r\n         has usually lost track of what happened the last time he was \r\n         on.  It reminds occasional users that it might be a good idea \r\n         to stop in more often.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Money:\r\n\r\n              As I'm sure you are aware, a Bulletin Board can cost a \r\n         lot to operate.  The trend is to charge som"b'e kind of \r\n         subscription.  There are a number of different ways in which \r\n         to do this.  A very large portion of the BBS community \r\n         believes that charging for access violates the spirit of \r\n         freedom of information that has been intertwined with \r\n         personal computers since their introduction.  You will face \r\n         that sort of resistance, especially if your BBS has had a \r\n         history of access at no charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n         FILES:\r\n\r\n              File areas'b' are arguably the heart of a BBS.  And just as \r\n         with a human heart, they can create a huge amount of trouble \r\n         if not properly taken care of.    \r\n\r\n              File Requests can be a valuable promotional tool.  Many \r\n         software companies allow potential buyers to request a demo \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     YOUR PRODUCT pg 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         from their support board to try the software before \r\n         purchasing it.  Some BBSs all'b"ow downloads of certain \r\n         informational files without having the caller registered or \r\n         verified.  This is potentially a very powerful feature and \r\n         probably should be implemented on your BBS if it isn't \r\n         already.  A file explaining your policies, the message bases \r\n         available, some hints on how to use your BBS (especially if \r\n         it uses a less well known software package), and maybe even a \r\n         registration or subscription form.  This gives the use"b"r an \r\n         idea of what your BBS is like and can leave him with a good \r\n         feeling in that he received something without having full \r\n         access.\r\n\r\n              BBSs are commonly cited as a major source of computer \r\n         viruses.  If you take great pains to check all files for \r\n         viruses before making them publicly available then you can \r\n         put many users' minds at ease.  Make sure you promote that \r\n         often on your BBS and in any advertising you do.  Sometime"b's a \r\n         virus will sneak through even the best virus checkers.  Track \r\n         down the offending file, delete it and apologize to those who \r\n         downloaded it.  But gently remind users that you are not \r\n         responsible for damage caused by the virus.  They downloaded \r\n         and used it at their own risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Message Bases:\r\n\r\n              If File Areas are the heart of a BBS, then the Message \r\n         Bases are the soul of your BBS.  That is where your users \r\n        'b' have the biggest opportunity to contribute to the board.  \r\n         This is also where you have the biggest opportunity to set \r\n         the image of the BBS.  Your message bases can be wide and \r\n         varied or narrow and focused on just a few topics.  Keep in \r\n         mind not everyone is going to be tactful and considerate.  \r\n         Some are rude and downright mean.\r\n\r\n              Nationally echoed message bases can be a valuable asset \r\n         to your board.  But there will be times when'b" there are \r\n         matters of interest in Waxahachie, Texas that folks in Erie, \r\n         Pennsylvania won't be interested in.  Chances are you have at \r\n         least one message base that is specific for local matters.  \r\n         You may want to consider opening up a few others depending on \r\n         the demand from your users.     \r\n\r\n\r\n         DOORS:\r\n\r\n              Your choice of Door programs create a twofold public \r\n         relations challenge right out of the box.  First, there may \r\n    "b"     be times in which you add a door that doesn't quite fit the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     YOUR PRODUCT pg 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         image you are trying to create on your BBS.  In that case \r\n         it's a fairly simple matter to remove the door program.  \r\n         Second, a very popular door could tie up your BBS for hours a \r\n         day with just a few users, causing frustration to others.  \r\n         This is particularly true of games.  \r\n\r\n\r\n         MI"b'SC:\r\n\r\n              Most BBSs run a screen full of Bulletins when the user \r\n         logs on.  These bulletins should be updated as often as \r\n         possible.  Callers need to know what\'s going on with your \r\n         BBS, even if it\'s just the latest scores for "Red Dragon."  \r\n         Most users don\'t read the bulletins on a regular basis.  But, \r\n         they leave the impression that you have a "happening" BBS.  A \r\n         business owner I once worked for said to me "The impression \r\n         t'b'hat we have business generates business."  He always made \r\n         sure there were cars in front of his business, even if they \r\n         belonged to employees.  Your bulletins can be the cars in \r\n         front of your business.  \r\n\r\n              Curiously, though, a lot of bulletins can also turn away \r\n         a user.  If you have a potload of bulletins, you might want \r\n         to think about moving some to areas in which they are more \r\n         appropriate.  Bulletins of game scores might be mov'b'ed to a \r\n         gaming conference, as an example.  Rules, policies and news \r\n         should be the primary considerations when developing log on \r\n         bulletins.  \r\n\r\n              There are several BBS and Sysop groups and associations \r\n         that you can become a member of.  There might even be one or \r\n         more in your area.  They are sources of support, solutions, \r\n         and other information.  If you are having trouble with \r\n         another sysop, the association can be a place'b' to arbitrate \r\n         your difficulties.  If worse comes to worse and you run afoul \r\n         of the law as a result of your BBS, the group may be able to \r\n         put you in touch with some legal help.\r\n\r\n              A meeting can also provide you with the opportunity to \r\n         unwind after a hard day of slaving over a hot keyboard.  I \r\n         strongly recommend joining a group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     YOUR PRODUCT pg 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r'b"\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                                \xb3GOAL SETTING?\n                                \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n              Even if you don't run a commercial BBS, you should think \r\n         of it as a business.  There is hardly any business that does \r\n         not take an inventory on a regular basis.   Any business that \r\n         does not analyze itself occasionally is doomed to failure.\r\n\r\n              Every six months or so, sit back and look at where your"b" \r\n         BBS has been, where it's at and where it's going.  Do you \r\n         have specific goals in mind?  What are you doing to meet \r\n         those goals?  How is your Public Relations campaign \r\n         reflecting the climb toward those goals?\r\n\r\n              Whatever you are up to, PROMOTE, PROMOTE, PROMOTE.  Tell \r\n         your users what's going on.  Tell your co-workers.  Tell the \r\n         dog.  Get the word out on the street somehow.  \r\n\r\n              This is only a cursory look at some t"b'he things you \r\n         should be aware of from a public relations standpoint as you \r\n         examine your BBS.  You might want to do things differently.  \r\n         Public relations is an art, and you may prefer to do yours in \r\n         oil while I prefer chalk.\r\n\r\n              I encourage you to write me and let me know what your \r\n         are doing in the area of Public Relations.\r\n\r\n         Robert Parson\r\n         2501 Phoenix\r\n         Fort Smith, AR 72901\r\n         501 646 9332 (voice)\r\n       'b'  Paradox of Arkansas BBS 501 484 0944/501 484 1043\r\n         (Fred Ayers, Sysop)\r\n         Jackalope Junction BBS 501 785 5381 (Steve Prado, Sysop)\r\n         internet   r.parson@genie.geis.com\r\n         GEnie      R.Parson\r\n         Fido       1:3822/1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     YOUR PRODUCT pg 5\r\n\r\n\r\n::::::::::::::\npr-rates.txt\n::::::::::::::\n                            \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                            \xb3BBS Public Relations?\n   'b'                         ?Aphelion Promotions?\n                            \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n                                 Robert Parson\r\n                                 2501 Phoenix\r\n                             Fort Smith, AR 72901\r\n                             501 646 9332 (voice)\r\n\r\n                                  Support BBS\r\n                    Paradox of Arkansas (Fred Ayers, Sysop)\r\n                           501 484 0944/501 484 1043\r\n                    Jackalope Junction (Steve Prad'b'o, Sysop)\r\n                                 501 785 5381\r\n\r\n                       Internet r.parson@genie.geis.com\r\n                                 Fido 1:3822/1\r\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                                ?

First, that image was tarnished by \r\n         stories of pirated software, then by stories of viruses and \r\n         most recently the rash of stories involving pedophiles using \r\n         BBSs to further their illegal activity (child pornography).\r\n\r\n              This guide is not intended to be the final word on \r\n         public relations for BBSs.  Someone is always coming up with \r\n         a new idea or 'b"putting a new spin on an old one.  This is just \r\n         a basic guide with some general rules of thumb you can use to \r\n         enhance the image of your BBS.  Keep in mind that there will \r\n         likely be some things in here that you disagree with.  In \r\n         that case, I'd like you to write to me, state your case, and \r\n         maybe you can persuade me to see things differently.  \r\n\r\n              In addition, I am not an attorney, cannot provide legal \r\n         advice, and this is not inte"b'nded to be a legal guide.  I \r\n         strongly suggest you hire an attorney familiar with \r\n         Communications Law and First Amendment issues BEFORE you have \r\n         trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                                  \xb3CONTENTS?\n                                  \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n         Who "They" Are.........................................1\r\n              The Public........................................1\r\n              T'b'he Media.........................................2\r\n         Finding the Media......................................2\r\n              Newspaper.........................................3\r\n              Television........................................4\r\n              Radio.............................................4\r\n         Your Product...........................................5\r\n              You are the BBS...................................5\r\n              Graphics....................................'b'......6\r\n              Making Changes....................................7\r\n         Tools of the Trade.....................................7\r\n              Business Cards and Stationary.....................7\r\n              Brochures and Fliers..............................8\r\n              Do it Yourself or Hire Someone....................9\r\n         News Products..........................................10\r\n              News Releases.....................................10\r\n              Public Service Ann'b'ouncements......................12\r\n              News Conferences..................................13\r\n         Handling the Media.....................................14\r\n         Market Research........................................16\r\n              Creating a Survey.................................16\r\n              Making the Call...................................18\r\n         Crisis Management......................................18\r\n              Friendly Faces....................................19\r\n'b'              First Amendment at Risk...........................19\r\n         Out of the Box.........................................20\r\n         Final Comments.........................................21\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                               \xb3Who "They" Are?\n                               \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n                                  The Public\r\n\r\n              A Summer 1993 survey by Dell Com'b'puter indicated that 55 \r\n         percent of the public does not take advantage of \r\n         technological advances.  That in itself is the single biggest \r\n         Public Relations problem a Sysop faces.  BBS users, \r\n         obviously, fall somewhere in the remaining 45 percent.  \r\n\r\n              Those who fear technology are the ones that are the most \r\n         difficult to explain electronic communications to.  They may \r\n         see computers as taking over their lives.  There are chips in \r\n   'b'      their cars, in their microwaves, in their stereos, and in \r\n         their VCRS.  Computers send them their utility bills, credit \r\n         card bills, track their income tax payments, and note when \r\n         their daughter is born.\r\n\r\n              Those in that 55 percent are not necessarily \r\n         technophobic.  Most of them are just technologically \r\n         disinterested.  These are the people that we should be most \r\n         concerned with from a Public Relations standpoint.  What they \r'b"\n         know about computers, modems and BBSs comes from the \r\n         mainstream media.  A reporter assigned to a story about BBSs \r\n         may or may not fully understand what they are reporting on.\r\n\r\n              The remaining 45 percent includes you and me, the expert \r\n         user, the average user and the novice user.  This group \r\n         doesn't need quite as much public relations massaging since \r\n         it already knows the benefits of using a modem to connect \r\n         with other peo"b'ple.\r\n\r\n              People that were overwhelmed when they first called a \r\n         BBS and decided it was too tough to try again also fall into \r\n         that 45 percent.  They have computers, they may be \r\n         technically adept, they can probably even program a VCR.  But \r\n         the mysteries of 8-N-1 elude them.  In addition, there are \r\n         those who were at one time active in the BBS community, but \r\n         are no longer involved.  Maybe they had a falling out with a \r\n         Sysop'b" or another user.  These are both disaffected users\r\n\r\n              There is also the group of people that have modems \r\n         because it came with their computer but they have not used \r\n         it.   Some because they don't know they have one, some \r\n         because they aren't interested in using it.\r\n\r\n              How can you distill all these diverse groups into one \r\n         simple Public Relations campaign?  Simply put, you can't.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  "b'         BBS-PR pg 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   The Media\r\n\r\n              News can be defined broadly as something that is out of \r\n         the ordinary (such as a murder) or something that is a matter \r\n         of public record (such as a City Council meeting).  \r\n         Generally, though, news is a change in the status quo.\r\n\r\n              Many people get upset over what is perceived as a \r\n         liberal or conservative slant in the news.  Because both \r\n         si'b'des get upset about slanted news, that indicates to me that \r\n         most media coverage is unbiased or at least politically \r\n         moderate.  So-called objective reporting is a relatively \r\n         recent invention.  Before the American Civil War, most \r\n         newspapers were just a cut above political tracts.  But \r\n         journalism history and theory is not our topic.\r\n\r\n              Most stories involving BBSs involve a crime that has \r\n         been committed, usually pirated software, vi'b"ruses, or \r\n         pornography.  Even though one BBS may be raided for \r\n         improprieties, it reflects poorly on the entire BBS community \r\n         by guilt through association.  This is similar to many \r\n         American's mistrust of all Arabs due to the misdeeds of a \r\n         few, as an example.  It isn't fair, it isn't right, but it's \r\n         The Way Things Are.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                              \xb3Finding the Media?\n                       "b"       \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n              The easiest way to find out who you need to talk to or \r\n         write to is by looking in the phone book.  All the TV and \r\n         Radio stations and Newspapers will be listed under those \r\n         categories.  You might want to also look for Magazines and \r\n         News Services.\r\n\r\n              A phone call can uncover a lot of information.  You will \r\n         need the media outlet's voice number, fax number, address and \r\n         the person to talk to o"b'r send mailings to.\r\n\r\n              Your best luck in the Public Relations arena is going to \r\n         be in the local media.  Remember that not all your public \r\n         relations efforts are going to be successful.  For instance, \r\n         most News Releases are thrown in the trash.  But if you keep \r\n         at it your efforts will pay off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Newspaper\r\n\r\n  'b'            Because of the rise of electronic information \r\n         distribution, many people have predicted the demise of \r\n         newspapers.  That\'s unlikely, at least for the next fifty to \r\n         one hundred years.  Yes, readership has declined.  \r\n         Newspapers, though, are chameleons and are able to adapt.  \r\n         Thirty years ago most newspapers looked like the New York \r\n         Times.  Most newspapers now have much more open and \r\n         "friendly" looks.  \r\n\r\n              They'b' are also the most powerful of all the media.  No \r\n         other media shapes and forms public opinion to the degree \r\n         newspapers do.  This is usually because they have larger news \r\n         staffs and much longer traditions than broadcast media.  \r\n         Print also has a permanence that broadcast does not have.    \r\n\r\n              As a Sysop, your Public Relations efforts should start \r\n         with the Editor or City Editor, whichever the case may be.  \r\n         These Editors will assign'b' stories to a reporter.\r\n\r\n              You may be tempted to change your mailing list to a \r\n         certain reporter.  Although this may seem like a good idea, \r\n         reporters tend to change jobs on a fairly regular basis (this \r\n         is especially the case in broadcast media).  You might opt to \r\n         add a reporter to your list, but make sure you continue to \r\n         send material to the Editor.\r\n\r\n              I do not recommend offering to write a column.  You will \r\n         run out'b' of things to write about much sooner than you think.  \r\n         Not only that, newspapers have access to syndicated columns \r\n         that may not deal specifically with BBSs, but will touch on \r\n         them occasionally.  \r\n\r\n              The opinion page provides several opportunities to get \r\n         your name and the name of your BBS out.  The Letters to the \r\n         Editor section can be quite effective in telling your \r\n         message.  You might even be asked occasionally to write a \r\n    'b'     guest opinion.  Use those opportunities whenever possible, \r\n         but be wary of writing too many Letters to the Editor.  If \r\n         they get printed often, you will lose your impact and become \r\n         just another shrill voice on the opinion page.\r\n\r\n              News about computers and computer technology tends to \r\n         become lodged in the Business section of a newspaper.  If \r\n         your paper has one, you need to put the Business Editor on \r\n         your mailing list.\r\n\r\n     'b'        Be careful with multiple mailings to newspapers.  If you \r\n         have a News Conference, you could have several people from         \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         one newspaper there.  There are few things that annoy editors \r\n         more than finding out that the paper had "overstaffed" a news \r\n         conference.  It might be wise to note on the announcement the \r\n         departments or individuals that are g'b'etting copies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Television\r\n\r\n              Television thrives on good video.  Too often, a story \r\n         with good video will override a good story with no video.  \r\n         That is part of the reason why even though nearly everyone \r\n         watches tv news, hardly anyone trusts it.  Despite that, \r\n         television can get your message across to more people in a \r\n         shorter period of time.\r\n\r\n              Assignment Editors are the people that tell th'b'e \r\n         reporters what stories they will tell that day.  Most of your \r\n         productive work with tv stations will be with the Assignment \r\n         Editor.  Assignment Editors work with the Producer, and both \r\n         are supervised by the News Director.\r\n\r\n              Should you be lucky and they are interested in doing a \r\n         story about the current state of art in BBS technology, \r\n         remember that you need to make yourself visually compelling.  \r\n         Show lots of activity 'b"on the screen, blinking on the modem, \r\n         the tangle of wires for the phone lines.  \r\n\r\n              Present yourself as a business professional, even if you \r\n         are operating a one-line, non-commercial system.  That \r\n         doesn't necessarily mean you need to wear a suit and tie, \r\n         although that would be a good idea.\r\n\r\n              BBSs have become the whipping boy of tv news during the \r\n         past year.  Sex and Pornography are probably the topics they \r\n         will be "b'most interested in, especially child pornography.  If \r\n         you are called out of the blue someday by a tv reporter \r\n         wishing to do an interview, those are the likely topics.  Be \r\n         prepared to dodge bullets.  \r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Radio\r\n\r\n              Radio Journalism is a dying art.  There was once a time \r\n         when no radio station would even think of not having a news \r\n         department.  Now many stations have only a morning newsperson \r\n         tha'b"t rewrites the morning paper, and they might not have even \r\n         that.  It's very tragic.\r\n\r\n              But there are still a very good number of radio stations \r\n         with active news departments.  For the most part, you will \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         deal directly with the News Director.  Some larger stations \r\n         may also have an Assignments Editor.\r\n\r\n              Radio stations will be looking for "b'stories that can be \r\n         told very quickly and have good "sound."  Normally, a radio \r\n         reporter will simply be seeking an interview.  But there may \r\n         be an occasion in which a reporter is doing a special report \r\n         or a series.  BBSs don\'t really have much sound to record, \r\n         but there is some.  Modem tones, connection alarms, and ANSI \r\n         music are a few.\r\n\r\n              Because the pace of radio news departments is even \r\n         faster than tv, believe it o'b'r not, it won\'t be uncommon for a \r\n         radio reporter to call on the phone to get a comment on a \r\n         breaking story or even a follow-up on a story idea you may \r\n         have presented them with in some correspondence.\r\n\r\n              If you are contacted on a "slow" news day, you and your \r\n         BBS could be included in a number of radio newscasts.  Even \r\n         in music intensive formats, radio news tends to be listener \r\n         active-- that is listeners pay close attention to the'b' news.\r\n\r\n              News/Talk stations are particularly good targets.  They \r\n         are nearly always looking for good people to interview on the \r\n         air.\r\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                                \xb3Your Product?\n                                \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n                                You are the BBS\r\n\r\n\r\n              First of all, you have to think of your BBS as a \r\n         product.  Whether you have a 32 line commercial BBS, a single \r\n  'b"       line hobby board or somewhere in between, you are selling a \r\n         service.  Just as with any other product, you have to decide \r\n         where and how your public relations efforts should best be \r\n         spent.  Would you sell Lambroghinis in rural Oklahoma?  You \r\n         can try, but you probably wouldn't sell very many.  And what \r\n         happens when your Lambroghini has a major recall?  How would \r\n         you handle the Public Relations crisis?\r\n\r\n              Now may be a good ti"b"me to look at your BBS and take an \r\n         inventory.  If you haven't already done so, print the file \r\n         PRODUCT.TXT included with this package.  It will help you \r\n         take stock of the strengths and weaknesses of your BBS.  \r\n\r\n              PRODUCT.TXT examines the inventory and looks at some of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         the immediate public relations problems that could occur as a \r\n         direct res"b'ult of the features of your BBS.  Since this file \r\n         goes into depth about particular items on your BBS that may \r\n         cause some Public Relations problems, we won\'t discuss it in \r\n         detail here, but we will touch on some of the same issues.\r\n\r\n              The first and foremost question you should ask yourself \r\n         is "Why should someone call my BBS?"  To answer that \r\n         question, let\'s create two BBSs to use as examples:\r\n\r\n              Beta BBS has message bases, file'b"s and a couple games.  \r\n         Delta BBS has message bases, files and a couple games.  \r\n         Nothing really different here.  The Sysop of Beta BBS is an \r\n         active participant in his BBS in that he writes messages on a \r\n         regular basis.  The Delta BBS Sysop turns up on occasion and \r\n         makes an announcement.  Hmmm.  Looks like Beta has a slight \r\n         edge; the Sysop doesn't seem so unreachable.  There is \r\n         nothing wrong with Delta BBS, but it seems so ordinary.  \r"b'\n         There are hundreds of other BBSs using the same software in \r\n         the same manner and it appears the Sysop is an out of state \r\n         landlord.  \r\n\r\n              If there is only one weapon I can give you in your \r\n         Public Relations campaign that weapon would be yourself.  You \r\n         must allow your personality to become a part of the BBS.\r\n\r\n              In this manner BBSs are identical to TV News.  They may \r\n         offer the same plate, but the plate is presented a litt'b"le \r\n         differently.  You might like the person who does the weather \r\n         more than the other station's weatherblond.  That is why you \r\n         watch Eyewitness News instead of The Newscenter or whatever \r\n         the case may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Graphics\r\n\r\n\r\n              Sometimes a subtle change in the graphics scheme can \r\n         make a big difference in how a user perceives your BBS.  If \r\n         you use a lot of bright,garish colors a caller may get the \r\n  "b"       impression that the BBS is loud and brash.  Look closely at \r\n         how TV stations use color.  They generally use two or three \r\n         colors to set the overall graphics image and everything else \r\n         is either based on those colors or is worked into them \r\n         somehow.       \r\n\r\n              You should also examine how your menus are laid out.  \r\n         Your first concern should be whether they make sense.  A \r\n         caller shouldn't have to scratch his head trying to figure "b'\r\n         out what he should do next, unless he really has no idea.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Secondly, is the picture busy?  A busy menu page takes \r\n         longer to draw and is harder to read.  If after the screen is \r\n         drawn and you find yourself distracted, chances are your \r\n         layout has too many elements.\r\n\r\n              Graphics artists for print publications talk about what \r\n         is 'b'called "white space."  That is the amount of nothingness \r\n         that surrounds text and pictures.  The more there is the more \r\n         pleasing to the eye the page is.  There is nothing wrong with \r\n         using a background to support your menus, but it should be \r\n         unobtrusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Making Changes\r\n\r\n              Whenever you change or add something you need to think \r\n         to yourself "Is this something that my users need or want?"  \r\n         You also'b" need to think of the image you want your BBS to \r\n         present.  If you have a Science Fiction themed BBS, that new \r\n         CD-ROM of Civil War statistics may not fit in very well.\r\n\r\n              I want to make the point, though, that you might prefer \r\n         to run a BBS that offers something of interest to everyone.  \r\n         But if you do have a thread that runs throughout the entire \r\n         system you need to think twice before making a change or an \r\n         addition.  If it doesn't "b"feel right to you then it probably \r\n         won't be kosher with your users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                             \xb3TOOLS OF THE TRADE?\n                             \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n              You have your computer(s), phone lines(s), software, \r\n         message bases, and file areas.  But do you have your \r\n         stationary and business cards?  Unless you are running a \r\n         commercial system, you probably don't (and many commercial \r"b"\n         systems don't either).\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Business Cards and Stationary\r\n\r\n              From time to time you'll want to write a letter as the \r\n         Sysop of your BBS.  This letter may be to a user, your city \r\n         officials, your Congressman or even to local media outlets.  \r\n         Your letter will carry more weight if it is on stationary.  \r\n         Make sure it has the name of your BBS, mailing address, voice \r\n         line and data line.  Your name and title are opti"b"ons since \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         you will be signing it anyway.\r\n\r\n              If you work as a salesperson, an engineer, or any other \r\n         service oriented business, you wouldn't think twice about \r\n         getting business cards.  They are an essential part of your \r\n         business armament.  You hand them to every new person you \r\n         meet during the course of your day.  You should do the same \r\n   "b'      for your BBS.  \r\n\r\n              Business cards are an effective way of getting the word \r\n         out about your BBS.  You don\'t need anything fancy.  Just the \r\n         name of your BBS, your name, your title, a mailing address, \r\n         your voice line and your data line.\r\n\r\n              As for your title, I would recommend System Operator.  \r\n         The average person on the street, including some who claim to \r\n         be computer literate, may not understand what "Sysop" means.\r\n\r\n      'b'        If you have even the slightest reason to write someone \r\n         on BBS stationary, then you should do it.  Always carry some \r\n         BBS business cards with you and pass them out at every \r\n         opportunity.  Stationary and business cards are inexpensive \r\n         and extremely effective.\r\n\r\n              One word of caution, though.  If your BBS is not \r\n         affiliated with your professional career, you need to make \r\n         sure you keep the two separated.  This can be a problem w'b'hen \r\n         handing out business cards in particular.  You might be \r\n         tempted to give a client cards from both work and your BBS.  \r\n         Should you do this, the client must be made aware that they \r\n         are two completely separate entities.  Not only that, but \r\n         your boss might not be too keen on the idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Brochures and Fliers\r\n\r\n              Brochures are also good promotional items for BBSs.   \r\n         Although they are not as necessary a'b"s business cards and \r\n         stationary, they can be very good tools.  Brochures can be \r\n         left at computer stores, taken to conventions, or used to \r\n         send in response to advertising.\r\n\r\n              Good brochures don't necessarily have to be \r\n         professionally produced, printed on glossy stock paper and \r\n         using four colors.  You can produce an effective brochure \r\n         using a desktop publishing program at home.  \r\n\r\n              A brochure should hit on the main "b"points you want to \r\n         make, have some graphics, and entice the reader into calling.  \r\n         A brochure is intended to introduce your product to potential \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         callers.  Don't feel you should fill up the entire brochure \r\n         with a lot of copy.  For one thing, if there's a lot to read, \r\n         most of it won't get read unless it is extremely compelling.  \r\n         The majority of "b'the time, though, simple will suffice.\r\n\r\n              When developing your brochure, you should design it by \r\n         cutting the page in thirds and deciding what needs to be on \r\n         which page.  Obviously, you want the name of the BBS, the \r\n         phone number and maybe a graphic on the front.  You get to \r\n         the nitty gritty of what is on your board inside.  The middle \r\n         section of the outside should be left blank so you can put an \r\n         address on it.\r\n\r\n              A 'b'flier generally is one page, and follows roughly the \r\n         same guidelines as those for a brochure.  In general, though, \r\n         you layout for the entire page instead of in thirds.\r\n\r\n              I mentioned "white space" earlier, and I want to \r\n         emphasize that again, especially in regard to your printed \r\n         materials.  The more white space you have, the more pleasing \r\n         to the eye your layout is.  Of course, that doesn\'t mean have \r\n         a blank page with only one sen'b'tence on it.  You do need to \r\n         keep your pages from looking cluttered and busy.\r\n\r\n                                Do it yourself\r\n                                      or\r\n                                 hire someone\r\n\r\n              Personal computers have liberated us to do work \r\n         ourselves that we would previously have hired someone to do.  \r\n         That includes personal publishing.  There are a number of \r\n         desktop publishing programs available at your friendly \r\n         'b'neighborhood computer store.  There are even some available \r\n         as shareware.\r\n         \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n         ?

For roughly b'  If you have a graphic that is used to help identify \r\n         your BBS you should use it.\r\n\r\n              Colored paper and spot color can be very effective.  But \r\n         you need to be very careful.  Your information can be hard to \r\n         read on dark paper.  Spot color is exactly that-- a small \r\n         touch of color to highlight something on the page.  But it \r\n         can be put in the wrong place.\r\n\r\n              A couple things to note about having your work done \r\n         professiona'b'lly:  colored paper and spot color usually cost \r\n         extra.  The printshop will also likely charge you to have a \r\n         graphic scanned and placed on your stationary or business \r\n         cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n::::::::::::::\nbbs-pr2.txt\n::::::::::::::\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                                \xb3News Products?\n                                \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n                                 News Releases\r\n\r\n              News Releases can be among the most effective t'b'ools you \r\n         use in your public relations efforts.

The News Media really does want \r\n         to know what is going on in the community and News Releases \r\n         provide valuable tip-offs for stories.\r\n\r\n              Among other things, News Releases can be used to make \r\n         yourself "The Expert" in the field.  There is much attention \r\n         being paid 'b'in Washington D.C. to the National Data Highway.  \r\n         By making yourself the expert in computer communications, \r\n         local media might contact you for local reaction to a story \r\n         about the National Data Highway or other topics, including \r\n         computer pornography.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              On any given day, a news department can receive dozens \r\n         of News Releases.  If you send a N'b"ews Release to a Newspaper, \r\n         or Radio or TV station, don't assume it will be used.  Lack \r\n         of a local angle, lack of timeliness, and obvious business \r\n         promotion are among the reasons most are thrown away.  The \r\n         biggest portion of those that are thrown out, though, are \r\n         News Releases that are poorly written.\r\n\r\n    \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n    ?

Those are also essential to a News Release.\r\n\r\n              You should also strive for clarity and brevity.  Even if \r\n         you consider yourself a poor writer, if you include all of \r\n         these factors,'b" your News Release will probably be at the very \r\n         least readable.\r\n\r\n              A News Release should have a Headline, a release date \r\n         (even if all it says is FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE), and contact \r\n         information in addition to the news itself.  Put the news \r\n         release on your BBS stationary and include a business card.  \r\n         Even if your News Release is thrown away, the business card \r\n         might be put into someone's rolodex.\r\n\r\n              Focus on your info"b'rmation.  What exactly is it you want \r\n         to convey?  The best news releases usually have one specific \r\n         point to make and everything else supports that one point.  \r\n         Think logically.  Your first paragraph, or the lead to use \r\n         journalistic jargon, should make your point clear.  The \r\n         second paragraph should have more information that supports \r\n         the first, the third should support the second and first, so \r\n         on and so on.  \r\n\r\n              Write s'b'imply.  Don\'t use "big" words unless you \r\n         absolutely have to.  They won\'t impress anyone.  You should \r\n         also write short simple sentences.  Long complex sentences \r\n         are harder to read.  Newspapers are written at an eighth \r\n         grade reading level.  Broadcasters have only one chance to \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         make the listener/viewer understand the story.  If you have \r\n         the medi'b'a confused you will be ignored.\r\n\r\n              Avoid the use of computer, modem or telecommunications \r\n         jargon.  Jargon that is used should be explained in simple \r\n         terms.  For instance: "GIFs are pictures that can be viewed \r\n         on a computer screen."  That may be oversimplified, but it \r\n         works.\r\n\r\n              One page is usually sufficient for a News Release.  Two \r\n         pages are acceptable, but more than that is pushing the \r\n         patience of the person you s'b'ent it to.  However, if you have \r\n         material to support your News Release, such as a graph or a \r\n         table, include that also.  If they want more information they \r\n         will call you.\r\n\r\n              Even if your News Release does not become recycling \r\n         fodder, it may not be used immediately.  It may be put into a \r\n         file for future use.  \r\n\r\n              The file PR-SAMP.TXT includes sample news releases along \r\n         with explanations of how and why they were writt'b'en.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Public Service Announcements\r\n\r\n              Radio and TV stations devote some programming time to \r\n         Public Service Announcements, or P.S.A.s.  Newspapers may not \r\n         call them that, but they run them as well.  These are a bit \r\n         trickier to write than a News Release mainly because there \r\n         are fairly strict rules concerning what is or is not a PSA.\r\n\r\n         The litmus tests for a PSA are:\r\n\r\n         1.  Is the group mentioned a profit o'b'rganization?\r\n\r\n         2.  Is the topic of the PSA controversial?\r\n\r\n         3.  Is the group mentioned controversial?\r\n\r\n         4.  Will the reader/listener/viewer feel they are hearing an \r\n         ad as opposed to a PSA?\r\n\r\n              If the answer to any of those is "yes" that doesn\'t \r\n         necessarily mean it is not a PSA.  Chances are, though, it \r\n         won\'t qualify.\r\n\r\n              PSAs have much in common with News Releases in that they \r\n         will include Who, What, When, an'b'd Where, but might not have a \r\n         Why.  If there is a cost involved, that needs to be included \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         as well.\r\n\r\n              PSAs will normally be sent to the PSA Director at Radio \r\n         and TV stations.  PSAs sent to Newspapers can usually be sent \r\n         to the Editor, who will know which department to send it to.\r\n\r\n              Many PSAs can be sent on a postcard.  The file PR- \r\n'b"         SAMP.TXT has a sample PSA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               News Conferences\r\n\r\n              My first thought on holding a News Conference is not to \r\n         hold one.  Unless you have something of extreme importance or \r\n         of a compelling nature, a News Conference probably won't be \r\n         necessary.\r\n\r\n              There are only two reasons I can think of for a BBS to \r\n         hold a News Conference.  One is when a BBS is launched, but \r\n         even that is of marginal news "b'value. The other is Crisis \r\n         Management.\r\n\r\n              Whichever the case may be, you need to be fully \r\n         prepared.  Have copies of your statement and support \r\n         materials available to distribute to members of the media \r\n         that attend.\r\n\r\n              If I am hesitant to recommend a News Conference, I am \r\n         adamantly against a Sysop holding a question and answer \r\n         session only.  If you have a News Conference, you had better \r\n         have something spec'b'ific to say or you are going to alienate \r\n         those attending.  \r\n\r\n              Although it is acceptable to read directly from your \r\n         printed statement during your News Conference, you need to \r\n         practice it several times beforehand so you are completely \r\n         familiar with it.  You might even want to practice the entire \r\n         News Conference.  This can be accomplished by having some \r\n         friends or business associates listen to your statement and \r\n         grill y'b'ou afterword.  Chances are many of the same questions \r\n         a reporter will ask will be asked by this "practice group."\r\n\r\n              Why do you need to answer questions following your \r\n         statement?  There may be something in your statement that was \r\n         unclear, or maybe needed to be expanded.  Sometimes you might \r\n         even be asked to repeat certain sections.  But when things \r\n         appear to be slowing down, don\'t be afraid to call an end to \r\n         the News Conference.'b"  Make yourself available for individual \r\n         interviews following the News Conference.  TV or radio \r\n         stations might want a more intimate sounding discussion of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 13\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         what the News Conference was about instead of the formal \r\n         statement.  A reporter might have a question he/she didn't \r\n         want to ask in a group setting.\r\n\r\n              Your News Conference will be compet"b"ing with all the \r\n         other news events going on throughout the day.  Don't waste \r\n         time and don't expect everyone invited to attend.  I've found \r\n         early afternoon or mid morning to be the best times to hold \r\n         News Conferences.\r\n\r\n              News Conferences can be a very productive method of \r\n         getting your message across.  But they are also quite \r\n         misused.  Hold a News Conference only if you feel the need is \r\n         absolutely imperative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   "b'                          \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                             \xb3Handling the Media?\n                             \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n              Timeliness is a very important factor when sending \r\n         material to the media.  \r\n\r\n              Most News Releases that are not dated can be mailed at \r\n         any time.  If they are going to be for release on a specific \r\n         date, they should be mailed one to two weeks before the date.  \r\n         Public Service Announcements 'b"and Event Schedules should be \r\n         sent two to four weeks before the event.\r\n\r\n              This gives the media plenty of time to schedule \r\n         reporters and other resources.\r\n\r\n              I do not recommend calling an Editor or reporter asking \r\n         when your News Release or PSA will be published or aired.  \r\n         They might consider this badgering.  However, you might call \r\n         and ask if they received it and had any questions.  That \r\n         doesn't guarantee that it wil"b'l be used, but it might increase \r\n         its chances, and you might even find out when it would be \r\n         used.\r\n\r\n              The Media is not the enemy.  When you are talking with a \r\n         reporter or a group of reporters there is no need to be \r\n         nervous.  Be friendly but professional.  Treat them as you \r\n         would your co-workers.\r\n\r\n              Generally, be calm but assertive.  You have the \r\n         information they want.  Because computer communications is \r\n         st'b'ill a burgeoning field, reporters may ask what you think \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 14\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         are dumb or inconsequential questions.  Just answer them \r\n         patiently.  Offer information you think is pertinent to the \r\n         issue.  The more facts they have the more accurate the story \r\n         will be.\r\n\r\n              If you read, see or hear a news story that you feel was \r\n         unfair in its coverage of the BBS Comm'b"unity, don't be afraid \r\n         to call or write the Editor or News Director and complain \r\n         about it.  Don't be angry, but point out what you feel was \r\n         unfair.  The worst thing you can do is get into an argument \r\n         with a member of the media.  Any headway you've made \r\n         previously can be destroyed.  You are more likely to be \r\n         listened to by being candid but keeping your head on your \r\n         shoulders.  They might make a retraction to the offending \r\n        "b" story or offer you the opportunity to set the record \r\n         straight.  If nothing else, you got it off your chest.\r\n\r\n              Video cameras are so ubiquitous these days that you \r\n         shouldn't give them a second thought.  You should be aware of \r\n         their presence though.  A dark sport jacket with a light \r\n         colored shirt works best on camera.  Flashy or very colorful \r\n         clothes can be very distracting.  The viewer might pay more \r\n         attention to what you are we"b"aring than what you are saying.\r\n\r\n              Never, ever, at any time knowingly tell a falsehood.  \r\n         You'll be caught and you'll be hung out to dry.  If you say \r\n         something that later turns out to be incorrect, then you can \r\n         honestly admit your mistake.  In addition, if there is \r\n         something you don't know, admit that also.  It's always \r\n         better to admit a lack of knowledge than it is to dance \r\n         around a question with a pseudo-answer.  You can always"b' look \r\n         up the correct answer and call the reporter later.\r\n\r\n              Drawing on that same theme, if you have gotten into a \r\n         situation in which you feel you have gotten in over your \r\n         head, defer the issue to someone you feel comfortable has the \r\n         proper skills and knowledge.  In most cases, a reporter will \r\n         accept your suggested replacement.  The only time it might \r\n         not work is when the reporter is asking about something that \r\n         directl'b'y impacts you or your BBS.  \r\n\r\n              This may seem obvious, but you should return calls \r\n         promptly.  Reporters are always under some sort of deadline \r\n         pressure.  The sooner you can return their calls, the more \r\n         they will appreciate you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 15\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                               \xb3Market Research?\n                          'b"     \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n              Who needs to do Market Research?  You do.  The days of \r\n         opening up a BBS with a few file areas and some message bases \r\n         are numbered.  Successful BBSs will be those that plan \r\n         carefully with an eye toward what users really want-- not the \r\n         desires of the noisy few.\r\n\r\n              While online questionnaires are quite useful, they often \r\n         don't go far enough or have a large enough base for you to \r\n         make long term"b" decisions.  The biggest problems are low \r\n         response rates and questions that answer themselves.  Very few \r\n         online surveys that I've seen provide enough qualitative \r\n         information for anything other than short term planning.\r\n\r\n              If you are planning on pulling in some new message \r\n         bases, but want to know which ones will actually be read by \r\n         users, then online questionnaires are quite sufficient for the \r\n         job.  But if you plan on opening a n"b'ew BBS, a major change in \r\n         image or thrust, or becoming a larger player in the BBS \r\n         community you probably need to do more than question your \r\n         active users.\r\n\r\n              But there are still times in which you must simply go \r\n         with your visceral instincts.  If you have just done the most \r\n         extensive survey in the history of the industry, you may just \r\n         have to do what your gut tells you to do, even if it is in \r\n         total disagreement with wha'b"t the research says you should do.\r\n\r\n              The easiest, least expensive, and probably the most \r\n         effective research for BBSs to do is call-out research.  Pick \r\n         up the phone and start dialing.  But you must have a method.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Creating a Survey\r\n\r\n              Depending on what you want to find out, you'll want to \r\n         angle your research in different directions.  A person \r\n         setting up a new BBS is going to need information different "b"\r\n         from that an established Sysop would need to consider whether \r\n         to expand or add services.\r\n\r\n              For our purposes, let's assume you want to do some basic \r\n         research on the group of people that use modems.  To make \r\n         things as easy as possible, we'll assume you will be \r\n         conducting 100 surveys.  This does NOT include people who \r\n         hang up on you or you terminate because they do not fit the \r\n         demographic profile you are looking for.\r\n\r"b"\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 16\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              The first thing you'll need to determine is the \r\n         demographic breakdown in your community as a whole.  What is \r\n         the percentage of men and women and their age groups?  This \r\n         information can easily be found at your local library.  Use \r\n         the most recent census data available.  Take those \r\n         percentages in each age/sex demo and conduct the same number \r"b"\n         of surveys (23% women aged 25 to 32 in your community, then \r\n         23 surveys with women in that age group).\r\n\r\n              The first thing you need in the survey is a set of \r\n         Terminal questions.  These questions help you determine the \r\n         age and sex groups you need, whether they own computers, \r\n         whether they own modems and how often they use modems.  If \r\n         they don't answer any of the questions in the appropriate \r\n         manner, you break off the interv"b'iew.  These people are NOT \r\n         included as part of your 100 completed surveys.\r\n\r\n              If you want an overview of the BBS community compared to \r\n         the community as a whole, you will need to keep track of the \r\n         people that are terminated.\r\n\r\n              Since we are developing a profile on the modem using \r\n         public in your community, we need a set of questions to \r\n         determine how often they use them and in what manner.  We \r\n         then need some questions'b' to find out what services they use, \r\n         what activities they participate in, and what they might see \r\n         as any shortcomings. \r\n\r\n         Finally, some questions on their hardware and software.\r\n\r\n              All these numbers can be inserted into a spreadsheet \r\n         program.  From there you can make pie charts or bar graphs to \r\n         represent just about anything and help you make planning \r\n         decisions.\r\n\r\n         There is a sample survey in the BBS-SAMP.TXT file.\r\n\r\n   'b'           Here are some terms that are in the sample survey that \r\n         you might want to know:\r\n\r\n              PROMPT-- Ask about listed items.  Subject may offer one \r\n         or more.\r\n              QUERY-- Ask for more, do NOT specify.  Ask "Anything \r\n         else?" and write down responses\r\n              (see XX)-- Depending on response to a question, then go \r\n         to the question with that number (eg: see 5B)\r\n              SPECIFY-- Subject may offer an answer.  If not, ask.\r\n          'b"    TERMINATE-- Bring to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Making the Call\r\n\r\n              You don't need to buy a list in order to make call out \r\n         research.  All it takes is a phone book or city directory.  \r\n         City directories are helpful in that they will have phone \r\n         numbers and addresses that may not be in the phone book.  \r\n         City directories are also expens"b'ive, especially when compared \r\n         to that phone book you received when you ordered a phone \r\n         line.\r\n\r\n              Starting with the first residential listing, keep \r\n         dialing down the column until you are able to get a completed \r\n         survey.  Skip the rest of that column, next column and start \r\n         at the top of the following.\r\n\r\n              For example, if you have a three column phone book (most \r\n         are), you get a completed survey on the tenth call in the \r\n'b'         second column.  Skip the remainder of the second column, skip \r\n         the third column, and then start again at the top of the \r\n         first column on the second page.  This will give you a fairly \r\n         random sample.\r\n\r\n              Also make sure you do not purposely call business \r\n         numbers.  Businesses get irritated when people make \r\n         unsolicited calls.  Many individuals do as well.  Expect a \r\n         lot of people to hang up on you.\r\n\r\n              ALWAYS thank 'b'the person at the end of the interview, \r\n         even if you terminate them after the first question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                              \xb3Crisis Management?\n                              \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n              The first thing to remember about Crisis Management is \r\n         to avoid creating one.  That isn\'t always possible.  In that \r\n         case, the second thing to remember is "Don\'t Panic."  You \r\n         simply don\'t have time.  Alw'b"ays keep your head.\r\n\r\n              It's quite unlikely BBSs will be responsible for \r\n         volcanic eruptions or toxic waste dumps.  Most crisis a BBS \r\n         would be involved in are legal in nature.  If that's the \r\n         case, you'll need to contact your attorney at once.\r\n\r\n              In fact, you might even want to consider keeping one on \r\n         retainer or having a pre-paid legal plan.  Your attorney \r\n         should be familiar with communications law and First \r\n         Amendmen"b't Issues.  Your local Bar Association should be able \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 18\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         to help you find one.\r\n\r\n              The media has easier access to prosecutors than to \r\n         defendants.  That is why in most criminal cases it appears a \r\n         suspect has already been convicted and hauled off even though \r\n         the case has not yet been brought to trial.  The good news is \r\n         that more defense attorneys'b" are becoming media savvy and are \r\n         willing to make statements to reporters.\r\n\r\n              Most of the time, the best thing to do is to let your \r\n         attorney do your talking for you.  Among other things, that's \r\n         what you are paying him for.  He will know what can and \r\n         cannot be said in public and is in a better position to deal \r\n         with legal intricacies that may come up.\r\n\r\n              For now, the online community tends to rally around BBS \r\n         operato"b'rs who have been accused of improprieties.  Unless \r\n         your counselor objects, you can begin drumming up support \r\n         from within the industry.  Among other things, you can make \r\n         legal documents available in computer readable form.  Contact \r\n         industry magazines such as BOARDWATCH, BBS CALLERS DIGEST and \r\n         CONNECT and let them know what is happening.  But you should \r\n         always advise or consult your attorney before doing any of \r\n         this.\r\n\r\n\r\n           'b"                     Friendly Faces\r\n\r\n              I've made this point before and I'll make it again.  \r\n         Reporters assigned to cover a story involving BBSs or other \r\n         online services may not fully understand the industry.  Some \r\n         of them may even be technophobes.\r\n\r\n              With that in mind, there is another position you can \r\n         work yourself into.  That is the position of the Local \r\n         Expert.  For sake of example, another Sysop has run into \r\n         tro"b'uble with the law.  You could make yourself available to \r\n         help explain what some of those complicated technological \r\n         terms are all about, making sure you stay clear of the legal \r\n         issues involved.  You may not get your face on TV or your \r\n         name printed in the paper, but you will be providing a \r\n         valuable service to your local media.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              The First Amendment\r\n                                    at Risk\r\n\r\n              The online co'b"mmunity is under attack.  There are many \r\n         in government who apparently believe First Amendment freedoms \r\n         should not be extended to BBSs and other online services, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 19\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         even if they don't explicitly state this.  The Clipper chip \r\n         is just one example.\r\n\r\n              The battle lines are being drawn in the courts and in \r\n         the mainstream media.  Solid wins in the j"b'ustice system will \r\n         help ensure a place for the First Amendment in the future.  \r\n         Diligent and deft manipulation of the media will help ensure \r\n         public support for the online community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                               \xb3Out of the Box?\n                               \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n              Many Sysops set up a BBS in a cloistered room, hunch \r\n         over a brightly lit screen late at night tweaking here and \r\n    'b'     tweaking there.  "Heh!" they think, "this new door game will \r\n         bring me a few more callers!"\r\n\r\n              Wrong.\r\n\r\n              You can be assured that new game is A) already on \r\n         another BBS in town, B) the potential new callers won\'t know \r\n         for sometime that you have it or C) potential new callers \r\n         won\'t care that you have it.\r\n\r\n              The game can wait \'til tomorrow.  Do something that is \r\n         more likely to bring in potential callers to your 'b"BBS in \r\n         particular and into the BBS community generally.  Get out of \r\n         the house.\r\n\r\n              Chances are your BBS or the local BBS or Sysops' \r\n         Association sponsors a picnic or some such at least once a \r\n         year.  Although this is a good idea, it usually is a \r\n         gathering a modem users.  You need to become more involved \r\n         with the community as a whole.\r\n\r\n              There are many, many opportunities to create a good \r\n         public relations im"b'age within the community.  Even though the \r\n         mainstream media should be a part of your public relations \r\n         efforts, you do not have to rely on them to tell your \r\n         message.\r\n\r\n              Your local Chamber of Commerce probably has some sort of \r\n         monthly or annual list of events going on in the community.  \r\n         There should be several that you can attend or co-sponsor on \r\n         behalf of the BBS.  You can also make yourself available to \r\n         talk to Servic'b"e Clubs and Youth Groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Have you thought of conducting a seminar?  Let's face \r\n         it, BBSs are not among the easiest computer applications to \r\n         use.  You could teach users and potential users about \r\n         telecommunications and BBSing.  With more and more BBSs \r\n         connecting to the Internet, a seminar on how to use the \r\n         Internet could be quite valuable"b".  As an aside, you might \r\n         even be able to bring in a few bucks by conducting seminars.\r\n\r\n              Schools are another place to make your mark.  Donate \r\n         your time to teach a class or be a guest in a class.  You \r\n         might even consider donating your old equipment to an \r\n         elementary school when you upgrade to newer equipment.  That \r\n         might even bring you some good press coverage.\r\n\r\n              If you have a laptop or an older computer you wouldn't \r\n      "b'   mind toting around, take it with you with a scaled down \r\n         version of your BBS to show people what it looks like.  Very \r\n         few things work better than a good visual aid.  \r\n\r\n              If you produce a newsletter for your BBS that is mailed \r\n         to users on a regular basis, add the local media outlets to \r\n         your mailing list.  Just as with News Releases, most \r\n         newsletters will be thrown out.  But sometimes someone will \r\n         grab an idea from one and produ'b"ce a story from it.  By golly, \r\n         you'll probably be the first person they call.\r\n\r\n              Everyday thousands of cars go past yours or you pass \r\n         them.  Bumper stickers are moving billboards.  Make them \r\n         available anytime you are out meeting the public.  Because \r\n         you must make a quick impression, just have the name of your \r\n         BBS and the data phone number printed on them.\r\n\r\n              Coffee mugs and t-shirts are good promotional items that \r\n         "b'can also bring in some money.  Sale items such as those are \r\n         really best for larger commercial systems, though.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                               \xb3Final Comments?\n                               \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n              I am quite conscience of the fact that I did not discuss \r\n         paid advertising in this manual.

It states the facts with few embellishments.  The \r\n         next news release is a bit more complicated since it starts \r\n         with a softer lead, or beginning.

Whether you \r\n         have a 32 line commercial BBS, a single line hobby board or \r\n         somewhere in between, you are selling a service.  Just as \r\n         with any other product, you have to decide where and how your \r\n 'b'        public relations efforts should best be spent.  \r\n\r\n              Now may be a good time to look at your BBS and take an \r\n         inventory.  The Inventory included at the beginning of this \r\n         file will help you take stock of the strengths and weaknesses \r\n         of your BBS.  Some of these things you may already have \r\n         thought of.  Others possibly not.  Whatever the case may be, \r\n         this is a very subjective matter and there are no right or \r\n         wrong answers.\r\n\r\n 'b'             We\'ll take this step by step and briefly examine some of \r\n         the immediate public relations problems your BBS may present \r\n         and some ways to solve those problems.\r\n\r\n              I want you to bear in mind that it is NOT my intention \r\n         to tell you how to run your BBS.  In addition, I don\'t think \r\n         there are any "bad" features for a BBS, except of course \r\n         those that are patently illegal.  If anything like that is \r\n         implied, it wasn\'t intended'b'.\r\n\r\n\r\n         BBS NAME:\r\n\r\n              The name of your BBS should be chosen very carefully and \r\n         it should be in keeping with the overall tone of the BBS.  \r\n         Chances are you wouldn\'t want to call your BBS "Thunder of \r\n         Cloven Hooves" if the emphasis is on scholarly Biblical \r\n         discussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Sysop:\r\n\r\n              If you are known to users mainly as the Sysop, that \r\n         could be creating an aloof image.  That could be the image \r\n         you want. 'b" On some larger boards with staffs that may be the \r\n         best way to handle administrative duties.  But if you want to \r\n         have a more folksy and personable board you need to make \r\n         yourself known.  Create an account with your name, if you \r\n         haven't already done so.  Encourage users to refer to you \r\n         with your name, instead of The Sysop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    YOUR PRODUCT pg 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    General"b' Interest/Special Focus\r\n\r\n              You may want to have a BBS with a little bit of \r\n         everything for everybody.  Even with cable becoming more \r\n         prevalent, the three major broadcast networks still have the \r\n         largest viewership.  A General Interest BBS with a very large \r\n         plate to offer will draw users but could overwhelm some \r\n         users, especially new users.  \r\n\r\n              A BBS with a specific interest runs the risk of being \r\n         too narrowly define'b"d.  There is probably a market for a BBS \r\n         about horse racing jockeys six feet and taller with green \r\n         eyes, but it's also so specialized it would attract few \r\n         callers (if any).\r\n\r\n\r\n         Users\r\n\r\n              Most BBS have very large user lists.  Many of those \r\n         lists are bogus in that they reflect all the people that have \r\n         visited since the BBS was established.  Some Sysops routinely \r\n         clean the chaff out of the user lists.  This is a good idea "b"\r\n         in that it makes it easier for Sysops to keep track of who is \r\n         active and who is not.  In addition it helps users who log in \r\n         only occasionally.  If a user hasn't logged on recently he \r\n         has usually lost track of what happened the last time he was \r\n         on.  It reminds occasional users that it might be a good idea \r\n         to stop in more often.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Money:\r\n\r\n              As I'm sure you are aware, a Bulletin Board can cost a \r\n         lot to operat"b'e.  The trend is to charge some kind of \r\n         subscription.  There are a number of different ways in which \r\n         to do this.  A very large portion of the BBS community \r\n         believes that charging for access violates the spirit of \r\n         freedom of information that has been intertwined with \r\n         personal computers since their introduction.  You will face \r\n         that sort of resistance, especially if your BBS has had a \r\n         history of access at no charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n         FILE'b'S:\r\n\r\n              File areas are arguably the heart of a BBS.  And just as \r\n         with a human heart, they can create a huge amount of trouble \r\n         if not properly taken care of.    \r\n\r\n              File Requests can be a valuable promotional tool.  Many \r\n         software companies allow potential buyers to request a demo \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     YOUR PRODUCT pg 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         from their support board to try the software before \r\n        'b" purchasing it.  Some BBSs allow downloads of certain \r\n         informational files without having the caller registered or \r\n         verified.  This is potentially a very powerful feature and \r\n         probably should be implemented on your BBS if it isn't \r\n         already.  A file explaining your policies, the message bases \r\n         available, some hints on how to use your BBS (especially if \r\n         it uses a less well known software package), and maybe even a \r\n         registration or subscrip"b"tion form.  This gives the user an \r\n         idea of what your BBS is like and can leave him with a good \r\n         feeling in that he received something without having full \r\n         access.\r\n\r\n              BBSs are commonly cited as a major source of computer \r\n         viruses.  If you take great pains to check all files for \r\n         viruses before making them publicly available then you can \r\n         put many users' minds at ease.  Make sure you promote that \r\n         often on your BBS and in any"b' advertising you do.  Sometimes a \r\n         virus will sneak through even the best virus checkers.  Track \r\n         down the offending file, delete it and apologize to those who \r\n         downloaded it.  But gently remind users that you are not \r\n         responsible for damage caused by the virus.  They downloaded \r\n         and used it at their own risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Message Bases:\r\n\r\n              If File Areas are the heart of a BBS, then the Message \r\n         Bases are the soul of your BBS.  That 'b'is where your users \r\n         have the biggest opportunity to contribute to the board.  \r\n         This is also where you have the biggest opportunity to set \r\n         the image of the BBS.  Your message bases can be wide and \r\n         varied or narrow and focused on just a few topics.  Keep in \r\n         mind not everyone is going to be tactful and considerate.  \r\n         Some are rude and downright mean.\r\n\r\n              Nationally echoed message bases can be a valuable asset \r\n         to your board.'b"  But there will be times when there are \r\n         matters of interest in Waxahachie, Texas that folks in Erie, \r\n         Pennsylvania won't be interested in.  Chances are you have at \r\n         least one message base that is specific for local matters.  \r\n         You may want to consider opening up a few others depending on \r\n         the demand from your users.     \r\n\r\n\r\n         DOORS:\r\n\r\n              Your choice of Door programs create a twofold public \r\n         relations challenge right out of the"b" box.  First, there may \r\n         be times in which you add a door that doesn't quite fit the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     YOUR PRODUCT pg 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         image you are trying to create on your BBS.  In that case \r\n         it's a fairly simple matter to remove the door program.  \r\n         Second, a very popular door could tie up your BBS for hours a \r\n         day with just a few users, causing frustration to others.  \r\n         This is particularly tru"b'e of games.  \r\n\r\n\r\n         MISC:\r\n\r\n              Most BBSs run a screen full of Bulletins when the user \r\n         logs on.  These bulletins should be updated as often as \r\n         possible.  Callers need to know what\'s going on with your \r\n         BBS, even if it\'s just the latest scores for "Red Dragon."  \r\n         Most users don\'t read the bulletins on a regular basis.  But, \r\n         they leave the impression that you have a "happening" BBS.  A \r\n         business owner I once worked for said to m'b'e "The impression \r\n         that we have business generates business."  He always made \r\n         sure there were cars in front of his business, even if they \r\n         belonged to employees.  Your bulletins can be the cars in \r\n         front of your business.  \r\n\r\n              Curiously, though, a lot of bulletins can also turn away \r\n         a user.  If you have a potload of bulletins, you might want \r\n         to think about moving some to areas in which they are more \r\n         appropriate.  Bulleti'b'ns of game scores might be moved to a \r\n         gaming conference, as an example.  Rules, policies and news \r\n         should be the primary considerations when developing log on \r\n         bulletins.  \r\n\r\n              There are several BBS and Sysop groups and associations \r\n         that you can become a member of.  There might even be one or \r\n         more in your area.  They are sources of support, solutions, \r\n         and other information.  If you are having trouble with \r\n         another sysop, 'b'the association can be a place to arbitrate \r\n         your difficulties.  If worse comes to worse and you run afoul \r\n         of the law as a result of your BBS, the group may be able to \r\n         put you in touch with some legal help.\r\n\r\n              A meeting can also provide you with the opportunity to \r\n         unwind after a hard day of slaving over a hot keyboard.  I \r\n         strongly recommend joining a group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     YO'b"UR PRODUCT pg 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                                \xb3GOAL SETTING?\n                                \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n              Even if you don't run a commercial BBS, you should think \r\n         of it as a business.  There is hardly any business that does \r\n         not take an inventory on a regular basis.   Any business that \r\n         does not analyze itself occasionally is doomed to failure.\r\n\r\n              Every six months or so, s"b"it back and look at where your \r\n         BBS has been, where it's at and where it's going.  Do you \r\n         have specific goals in mind?  What are you doing to meet \r\n         those goals?  How is your Public Relations campaign \r\n         reflecting the climb toward those goals?\r\n\r\n              Whatever you are up to, PROMOTE, PROMOTE, PROMOTE.  Tell \r\n         your users what's going on.  Tell your co-workers.  Tell the \r\n         dog.  Get the word out on the street somehow.  \r\n\r\n              This is"b' only a cursory look at some the things you \r\n         should be aware of from a public relations standpoint as you \r\n         examine your BBS.  You might want to do things differently.  \r\n         Public relations is an art, and you may prefer to do yours in \r\n         oil while I prefer chalk.\r\n\r\n              I encourage you to write me and let me know what your \r\n         are doing in the area of Public Relations.\r\n\r\n         Robert Parson\r\n         2501 Phoenix\r\n         Fort Smith, AR 72901\r\n        'b' 501 646 9332 (voice)\r\n         Paradox of Arkansas BBS 501 484 0944/501 484 1043\r\n         (Fred Ayers, Sysop)\r\n         Jackalope Junction BBS 501 785 5381 (Steve Prado, Sysop)\r\n         internet   r.parson@genie.geis.com\r\n         GEnie      R.Parson\r\n         Fido       1:3822/1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     YOUR PRODUCT pg 5\r\n\r\n\r\n::::::::::::::\npr-rates.txt\n::::::::::::::\n                            \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                        'b'    \xb3BBS Public Relations?\n                            ?Aphelion Promotions?\n                            \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n                                 Robert Parson\r\n                                 2501 Phoenix\r\n                             Fort Smith, AR 72901\r\n                             501 646 9332 (voice)\r\n\r\n                                  Support BBS\r\n                    Paradox of Arkansas (Fred Ayers, Sysop)\r\n                           501 484 0944/501 484 1043\r\n                    'b'Jackalope Junction (Steve Prado, Sysop)\r\n                                 501 785 5381\r\n\r\n                       Internet r.parson@genie.geis.com\r\n                                 Fido 1:3822/1\r\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                                ?

First, that image was tarnished by \r\n         stories of pirated software, then by stories of viruses and \r\n         most recently the rash of stories involving pedophiles using \r\n         BBSs to further their illegal activity (child pornography).\r\n\r\n              This guide is not intended to be the final word on \r\n         public relations for BBSs.  Someone is always coming up wi'b"th \r\n         a new idea or putting a new spin on an old one.  This is just \r\n         a basic guide with some general rules of thumb you can use to \r\n         enhance the image of your BBS.  Keep in mind that there will \r\n         likely be some things in here that you disagree with.  In \r\n         that case, I'd like you to write to me, state your case, and \r\n         maybe you can persuade me to see things differently.  \r\n\r\n              In addition, I am not an attorney, cannot provide legal \r\n         "b'advice, and this is not intended to be a legal guide.

That in itself is the single biggest \r\n         Public Relations problem a Sysop faces.  BBS users, \r\n         obviously, fall somewhere in the remaining 45 percent.  \r\n\r\n              Those who fear technology are the ones that are the most \r\n         difficult to explain electronic communications to.  They may \r\n         see computers as taking over their live'b's.  There are chips in \r\n         their cars, in their microwaves, in their stereos, and in \r\n         their VCRS.  Computers send them their utility bills, credit \r\n         card bills, track their income tax payments, and note when \r\n         their daughter is born.\r\n\r\n              Those in that 55 percent are not necessarily \r\n         technophobic.  Most of them are just technologically \r\n         disinterested.  These are the people that we should be most \r\n         concerned with from a Public Relati'b"ons standpoint.  What they \r\n         know about computers, modems and BBSs comes from the \r\n         mainstream media.  A reporter assigned to a story about BBSs \r\n         may or may not fully understand what they are reporting on.\r\n\r\n              The remaining 45 percent includes you and me, the expert \r\n         user, the average user and the novice user.  This group \r\n         doesn't need quite as much public relations massaging since \r\n         it already knows the benefits of using a modem to conne"b'ct \r\n         with other people.\r\n\r\n              People that were overwhelmed when they first called a \r\n         BBS and decided it was too tough to try again also fall into \r\n         that 45 percent.  They have computers, they may be \r\n         technically adept, they can probably even program a VCR.  But \r\n         the mysteries of 8-N-1 elude them.  In addition, there are \r\n         those who were at one time active in the BBS community, but \r\n         are no longer involved.  Maybe they had a falling'b" out with a \r\n         Sysop or another user.  These are both disaffected users\r\n\r\n              There is also the group of people that have modems \r\n         because it came with their computer but they have not used \r\n         it.   Some because they don't know they have one, some \r\n         because they aren't interested in using it.\r\n\r\n              How can you distill all these diverse groups into one \r\n         simple Public Relations campaign?  Simply put, you can't.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      "b'                                     BBS-PR pg 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   The Media\r\n\r\n              News can be defined broadly as something that is out of \r\n         the ordinary (such as a murder) or something that is a matter \r\n         of public record (such as a City Council meeting).  \r\n         Generally, though, news is a change in the status quo.\r\n\r\n              Many people get upset over what is perceived as a \r\n         liberal or conservative slant in the news.'b'  Because both \r\n         sides get upset about slanted news, that indicates to me that \r\n         most media coverage is unbiased or at least politically \r\n         moderate.  So-called objective reporting is a relatively \r\n         recent invention.  Before the American Civil War, most \r\n         newspapers were just a cut above political tracts.  But \r\n         journalism history and theory is not our topic.\r\n\r\n              Most stories involving BBSs involve a crime that has \r\n         been committed, 'b"usually pirated software, viruses, or \r\n         pornography.  Even though one BBS may be raided for \r\n         improprieties, it reflects poorly on the entire BBS community \r\n         by guilt through association.  This is similar to many \r\n         American's mistrust of all Arabs due to the misdeeds of a \r\n         few, as an example.  It isn't fair, it isn't right, but it's \r\n         The Way Things Are.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                              \xb3Finding the Me"b"dia?\n                              \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n              The easiest way to find out who you need to talk to or \r\n         write to is by looking in the phone book.  All the TV and \r\n         Radio stations and Newspapers will be listed under those \r\n         categories.  You might want to also look for Magazines and \r\n         News Services.\r\n\r\n              A phone call can uncover a lot of information.  You will \r\n         need the media outlet's voice number, fax number, address and \r\n    "b'     the person to talk to or send mailings to.\r\n\r\n              Your best luck in the Public Relations arena is going to \r\n         be in the local media.  Remember that not all your public \r\n         relations efforts are going to be successful.  For instance, \r\n         most News Releases are thrown in the trash.  But if you keep \r\n         at it your efforts will pay off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      'b'             Newspaper\r\n\r\n              Because of the rise of electronic information \r\n         distribution, many people have predicted the demise of \r\n         newspapers.  That\'s unlikely, at least for the next fifty to \r\n         one hundred years.  Yes, readership has declined.  \r\n         Newspapers, though, are chameleons and are able to adapt.  \r\n         Thirty years ago most newspapers looked like the New York \r\n         Times.  Most newspapers now have much more open and \r\n         "friendly" lo'b'oks.  \r\n\r\n              They are also the most powerful of all the media.  No \r\n         other media shapes and forms public opinion to the degree \r\n         newspapers do.  This is usually because they have larger news \r\n         staffs and much longer traditions than broadcast media.  \r\n         Print also has a permanence that broadcast does not have.    \r\n\r\n              As a Sysop, your Public Relations efforts should start \r\n         with the Editor or City Editor, whichever the case may be.  \r\n      'b'   These Editors will assign stories to a reporter.\r\n\r\n              You may be tempted to change your mailing list to a \r\n         certain reporter.  Although this may seem like a good idea, \r\n         reporters tend to change jobs on a fairly regular basis (this \r\n         is especially the case in broadcast media).  You might opt to \r\n         add a reporter to your list, but make sure you continue to \r\n         send material to the Editor.\r\n\r\n              I do not recommend offering to write a column. 'b' You will \r\n         run out of things to write about much sooner than you think.  \r\n         Not only that, newspapers have access to syndicated columns \r\n         that may not deal specifically with BBSs, but will touch on \r\n         them occasionally.  \r\n\r\n              The opinion page provides several opportunities to get \r\n         your name and the name of your BBS out.  The Letters to the \r\n         Editor section can be quite effective in telling your \r\n         message.  You might even be asked oc'b'casionally to write a \r\n         guest opinion.  Use those opportunities whenever possible, \r\n         but be wary of writing too many Letters to the Editor.  If \r\n         they get printed often, you will lose your impact and become \r\n         just another shrill voice on the opinion page.\r\n\r\n              News about computers and computer technology tends to \r\n         become lodged in the Business section of a newspaper.  If \r\n         your paper has one, you need to put the Business Editor on \r\n        'b' your mailing list.\r\n\r\n             Be careful with multiple mailings to newspapers.  If you \r\n         have a News Conference, you could have several people from         \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         one newspaper there.  There are few things that annoy editors \r\n         more than finding out that the paper had "overstaffed" a news \r\n         conference.  It might be wise to note on the announcement the \r\n         departmen'b'ts or individuals that are getting copies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Television\r\n\r\n              Television thrives on good video.  Too often, a story \r\n         with good video will override a good story with no video.  \r\n         That is part of the reason why even though nearly everyone \r\n         watches tv news, hardly anyone trusts it.  Despite that, \r\n         television can get your message across to more people in a \r\n         shorter period of time.\r\n\r\n              Assignment Editors'b' are the people that tell the \r\n         reporters what stories they will tell that day.  Most of your \r\n         productive work with tv stations will be with the Assignment \r\n         Editor.  Assignment Editors work with the Producer, and both \r\n         are supervised by the News Director.\r\n\r\n              Should you be lucky and they are interested in doing a \r\n         story about the current state of art in BBS technology, \r\n         remember that you need to make yourself visually compelling.  \r\n   'b"      Show lots of activity on the screen, blinking on the modem, \r\n         the tangle of wires for the phone lines.  \r\n\r\n              Present yourself as a business professional, even if you \r\n         are operating a one-line, non-commercial system.  That \r\n         doesn't necessarily mean you need to wear a suit and tie, \r\n         although that would be a good idea.\r\n\r\n              BBSs have become the whipping boy of tv news during the \r\n         past year.  Sex and Pornography are probably the top"b'ics they \r\n         will be most interested in, especially child pornography.  If \r\n         you are called out of the blue someday by a tv reporter \r\n         wishing to do an interview, those are the likely topics.  Be \r\n         prepared to dodge bullets.  \r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Radio\r\n\r\n              Radio Journalism is a dying art.  There was once a time \r\n         when no radio station would even think of not having a news \r\n         department.  Now many stations have only a morni'b"ng newsperson \r\n         that rewrites the morning paper, and they might not have even \r\n         that.  It's very tragic.\r\n\r\n              But there are still a very good number of radio stations \r\n         with active news departments.  For the most part, you will \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         deal directly with the News Director.  Some larger stations \r\n         may also have an Assignments Editor.\r\n\r\n              Radio s"b'tations will be looking for stories that can be \r\n         told very quickly and have good "sound."  Normally, a radio \r\n         reporter will simply be seeking an interview.  But there may \r\n         be an occasion in which a reporter is doing a special report \r\n         or a series.  BBSs don\'t really have much sound to record, \r\n         but there is some.  Modem tones, connection alarms, and ANSI \r\n         music are a few.\r\n\r\n              Because the pace of radio news departments is even \r\n         'b'faster than tv, believe it or not, it won\'t be uncommon for a \r\n         radio reporter to call on the phone to get a comment on a \r\n         breaking story or even a follow-up on a story idea you may \r\n         have presented them with in some correspondence.\r\n\r\n              If you are contacted on a "slow" news day, you and your \r\n         BBS could be included in a number of radio newscasts.  Even \r\n         in music intensive formats, radio news tends to be listener \r\n         active-- that is listener'b's pay close attention to the news.\r\n\r\n              News/Talk stations are particularly good targets.  They \r\n         are nearly always looking for good people to interview on the \r\n         air.\r\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                                \xb3Your Product?\n                                \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n                                You are the BBS\r\n\r\n\r\n              First of all, you have to think of your BBS as a \r\n         product.  Whether you have a 32 line c'b"ommercial BBS, a single \r\n         line hobby board or somewhere in between, you are selling a \r\n         service.  Just as with any other product, you have to decide \r\n         where and how your public relations efforts should best be \r\n         spent.  Would you sell Lambroghinis in rural Oklahoma?  You \r\n         can try, but you probably wouldn't sell very many.  And what \r\n         happens when your Lambroghini has a major recall?  How would \r\n         you handle the Public Relations crisis?\r\n\r\n      "b"        Now may be a good time to look at your BBS and take an \r\n         inventory.  If you haven't already done so, print the file \r\n         PRODUCT.TXT included with this package.  It will help you \r\n         take stock of the strengths and weaknesses of your BBS.  \r\n\r\n              PRODUCT.TXT examines the inventory and looks at some of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         the immediate public relations problems that could occu"b'r as a \r\n         direct result of the features of your BBS.  Since this file \r\n         goes into depth about particular items on your BBS that may \r\n         cause some Public Relations problems, we won\'t discuss it in \r\n         detail here, but we will touch on some of the same issues.\r\n\r\n              The first and foremost question you should ask yourself \r\n         is "Why should someone call my BBS?"  To answer that \r\n         question, let\'s create two BBSs to use as examples:\r\n\r\n              Beta'b" BBS has message bases, files and a couple games.  \r\n         Delta BBS has message bases, files and a couple games.  \r\n         Nothing really different here.  The Sysop of Beta BBS is an \r\n         active participant in his BBS in that he writes messages on a \r\n         regular basis.  The Delta BBS Sysop turns up on occasion and \r\n         makes an announcement.  Hmmm.  Looks like Beta has a slight \r\n         edge; the Sysop doesn't seem so unreachable.  There is \r\n         nothing wrong with Delta BBS, "b'but it seems so ordinary.  \r\n         There are hundreds of other BBSs using the same software in \r\n         the same manner and it appears the Sysop is an out of state \r\n         landlord.  \r\n\r\n              If there is only one weapon I can give you in your \r\n         Public Relations campaign that weapon would be yourself.  You \r\n         must allow your personality to become a part of the BBS.\r\n\r\n              In this manner BBSs are identical to TV News.  They may \r\n         offer the same plate, but t'b"he plate is presented a little \r\n         differently.  You might like the person who does the weather \r\n         more than the other station's weatherblond.  That is why you \r\n         watch Eyewitness News instead of The Newscenter or whatever \r\n         the case may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Graphics\r\n\r\n\r\n              Sometimes a subtle change in the graphics scheme can \r\n         make a big difference in how a user perceives your BBS.  If \r\n         you use a lot of bright,garish colo"b"rs a caller may get the \r\n         impression that the BBS is loud and brash.  Look closely at \r\n         how TV stations use color.  They generally use two or three \r\n         colors to set the overall graphics image and everything else \r\n         is either based on those colors or is worked into them \r\n         somehow.       \r\n\r\n              You should also examine how your menus are laid out.  \r\n         Your first concern should be whether they make sense.  A \r\n         caller shouldn't have to scratc"b'h his head trying to figure \r\n         out what he should do next, unless he really has no idea.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Secondly, is the picture busy?  A busy menu page takes \r\n         longer to draw and is harder to read.  If after the screen is \r\n         drawn and you find yourself distracted, chances are your \r\n         layout has too many elements.\r\n\r\n              Graphics artists for print publications ta'b'lk about what \r\n         is called "white space."  That is the amount of nothingness \r\n         that surrounds text and pictures.  The more there is the more \r\n         pleasing to the eye the page is.  There is nothing wrong with \r\n         using a background to support your menus, but it should be \r\n         unobtrusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Making Changes\r\n\r\n              Whenever you change or add something you need to think \r\n         to yourself "Is this something that my users need or'b' want?"  \r\n         You also need to think of the image you want your BBS to \r\n         present.  If you have a Science Fiction themed BBS, that new \r\n         CD-ROM of Civil War statistics may not fit in very well.\r\n\r\n              I want to make the point, though, that you might prefer \r\n         to run a BBS that offers something of interest to everyone.  \r\n         But if you do have a thread that runs throughout the entire \r\n         system you need to think twice before making a change or an \r\n      'b"   addition.  If it doesn't feel right to you then it probably \r\n         won't be kosher with your users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                             \xb3TOOLS OF THE TRADE?\n                             \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n              You have your computer(s), phone lines(s), software, \r\n         message bases, and file areas.  But do you have your \r\n         stationary and business cards?  Unless you are running a \r\n         commercial system, you probably "b"don't (and many commercial \r\n         systems don't either).\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Business Cards and Stationary\r\n\r\n              From time to time you'll want to write a letter as the \r\n         Sysop of your BBS.  This letter may be to a user, your city \r\n         officials, your Congressman or even to local media outlets.  \r\n         Your letter will carry more weight if it is on stationary.  \r\n         Make sure it has the name of your BBS, mailing address, voice \r\n         line and data line.  "b"Your name and title are options since \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         you will be signing it anyway.\r\n\r\n              If you work as a salesperson, an engineer, or any other \r\n         service oriented business, you wouldn't think twice about \r\n         getting business cards.  They are an essential part of your \r\n         business armament.  You hand them to every new person you \r\n         meet during the course of your day.  "b"You should do the same \r\n         for your BBS.  \r\n\r\n              Business cards are an effective way of getting the word \r\n         out about your BBS.  You don't need anything fancy.  Just the \r\n         name of your BBS, your name, your title, a mailing address, \r\n         your voice line and your data line.\r\n\r\n              As for your title, I would recommend System Operator.  \r\n         The average person on the street, including some who claim to \r\n         be computer literate, may not understand w"b'hat "Sysop" means.\r\n\r\n              If you have even the slightest reason to write someone \r\n         on BBS stationary, then you should do it.  Always carry some \r\n         BBS business cards with you and pass them out at every \r\n         opportunity.  Stationary and business cards are inexpensive \r\n         and extremely effective.\r\n\r\n              One word of caution, though.  If your BBS is not \r\n         affiliated with your professional career, you need to make \r\n         sure you keep the two separat'b'ed.  This can be a problem when \r\n         handing out business cards in particular.  You might be \r\n         tempted to give a client cards from both work and your BBS.  \r\n         Should you do this, the client must be made aware that they \r\n         are two completely separate entities.  Not only that, but \r\n         your boss might not be too keen on the idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Brochures and Fliers\r\n\r\n              Brochures are also good promotional items for BBSs.   \r\n         Although'b" they are not as necessary as business cards and \r\n         stationary, they can be very good tools.  Brochures can be \r\n         left at computer stores, taken to conventions, or used to \r\n         send in response to advertising.\r\n\r\n              Good brochures don't necessarily have to be \r\n         professionally produced, printed on glossy stock paper and \r\n         using four colors.  You can produce an effective brochure \r\n         using a desktop publishing program at home.  \r\n\r\n              A broc"b"hure should hit on the main points you want to \r\n         make, have some graphics, and entice the reader into calling.  \r\n         A brochure is intended to introduce your product to potential \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         callers.  Don't feel you should fill up the entire brochure \r\n         with a lot of copy.  For one thing, if there's a lot to read, \r\n         most of it won't get read unless it is extremely compelling. "b' \r\n         The majority of the time, though, simple will suffice.\r\n\r\n              When developing your brochure, you should design it by \r\n         cutting the page in thirds and deciding what needs to be on \r\n         which page.  Obviously, you want the name of the BBS, the \r\n         phone number and maybe a graphic on the front.  You get to \r\n         the nitty gritty of what is on your board inside.  The middle \r\n         section of the outside should be left blank so you can put an \r\n         addres'b's on it.\r\n\r\n              A flier generally is one page, and follows roughly the \r\n         same guidelines as those for a brochure.  In general, though, \r\n         you layout for the entire page instead of in thirds.\r\n\r\n              I mentioned "white space" earlier, and I want to \r\n         emphasize that again, especially in regard to your printed \r\n         materials.  The more white space you have, the more pleasing \r\n         to the eye your layout is.  Of course, that doesn\'t mean have \r\n         a 'b'blank page with only one sentence on it.  You do need to \r\n         keep your pages from looking cluttered and busy.\r\n\r\n                                Do it yourself\r\n                                      or\r\n                                 hire someone\r\n\r\n              Personal computers have liberated us to do work \r\n         ourselves that we would previously have hired someone to do.  \r\n         That includes personal publishing.  There are a number of \r\n         desktop publishing programs available 'b'at your friendly \r\n         neighborhood computer store.

For roughly b'lly on the \r\n         cards.  If you have a graphic that is used to help identify \r\n         your BBS you should use it.\r\n\r\n              Colored paper and spot color can be very effective.  But \r\n         you need to be very careful.  Your information can be hard to \r\n         read on dark paper.  Spot color is exactly that-- a small \r\n         touch of color to highlight something on the page.  But it \r\n         can be put in the wrong place.\r\n\r\n              A couple things to note about having your work'b' done \r\n         professionally:  colored paper and spot color usually cost \r\n         extra.  The printshop will also likely charge you to have a \r\n         graphic scanned and placed on your stationary or business \r\n         cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n::::::::::::::\nbbs-pr2.txt\n::::::::::::::\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                                \xb3News Products?\n                                \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n                                 News Releases\r\n\r\n              News Releases can b'b'e among the most effective tools you \r\n         use in your public relations efforts.  This may seem hard to \r\n         believe, but much of what we read, hear or see in the news is \r\n         prompted by a news release.  The News Media really does want \r\n         to know what is going on in the community and News Releases \r\n         provide valuable tip-offs for stories.\r\n\r\n              Among other things, News Releases can be used to make \r\n         yourself "The Expert" in the field.  There is much atte'b'ntion \r\n         being paid in Washington D.C. to the National Data Highway.  \r\n         By making yourself the expert in computer communications, \r\n         local media might contact you for local reaction to a story \r\n         about the National Data Highway or other topics, including \r\n         computer pornography.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              On any given day, a news department can receive dozens \r\n         of New'b"s Releases.  If you send a News Release to a Newspaper, \r\n         or Radio or TV station, don't assume it will be used.  Lack \r\n         of a local angle, lack of timeliness, and obvious business \r\n         promotion are among the reasons most are thrown away.  The \r\n         biggest portion of those that are thrown out, though, are \r\n         News Releases that are poorly written.\r\n\r\n    \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n    ?

Those are also essential to a News Release.\r\n\r\n              You should also strive for clarity and brevity.  Even if \r\n         you consider yourself a poor writer, if you include all 'b"of \r\n         these factors, your News Release will probably be at the very \r\n         least readable.\r\n\r\n              A News Release should have a Headline, a release date \r\n         (even if all it says is FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE), and contact \r\n         information in addition to the news itself.  Put the news \r\n         release on your BBS stationary and include a business card.  \r\n         Even if your News Release is thrown away, the business card \r\n         might be put into someone's rolodex.\r\n\r\n    "b'          Focus on your information.  What exactly is it you want \r\n         to convey?  The best news releases usually have one specific \r\n         point to make and everything else supports that one point.  \r\n         Think logically.  Your first paragraph, or the lead to use \r\n         journalistic jargon, should make your point clear.  The \r\n         second paragraph should have more information that supports \r\n         the first, the third should support the second and first, so \r\n         on and so on'b'.  \r\n\r\n              Write simply.  Don\'t use "big" words unless you \r\n         absolutely have to.  They won\'t impress anyone.  You should \r\n         also write short simple sentences.  Long complex sentences \r\n         are harder to read.  Newspapers are written at an eighth \r\n         grade reading level.  Broadcasters have only one chance to \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         make the listener/viewer understand the story.  If 'b'you have \r\n         the media confused you will be ignored.\r\n\r\n              Avoid the use of computer, modem or telecommunications \r\n         jargon.  Jargon that is used should be explained in simple \r\n         terms.  For instance: "GIFs are pictures that can be viewed \r\n         on a computer screen."  That may be oversimplified, but it \r\n         works.\r\n\r\n              One page is usually sufficient for a News Release.  Two \r\n         pages are acceptable, but more than that is pushing the \r\n         'b'patience of the person you sent it to.  However, if you have \r\n         material to support your News Release, such as a graph or a \r\n         table, include that also.  If they want more information they \r\n         will call you.\r\n\r\n              Even if your News Release does not become recycling \r\n         fodder, it may not be used immediately.  It may be put into a \r\n         file for future use.  \r\n\r\n              The file PR-SAMP.TXT includes sample news releases along \r\n         with explanations of'b' how and why they were written.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Public Service Announcements\r\n\r\n              Radio and TV stations devote some programming time to \r\n         Public Service Announcements, or P.S.A.s.  Newspapers may not \r\n         call them that, but they run them as well.  These are a bit \r\n         trickier to write than a News Release mainly because there \r\n         are fairly strict rules concerning what is or is not a PSA.\r\n\r\n         The litmus tests for a PSA are:\r\n\r\n         1.  Is th'b'e group mentioned a profit organization?\r\n\r\n         2.  Is the topic of the PSA controversial?\r\n\r\n         3.  Is the group mentioned controversial?\r\n\r\n         4.  Will the reader/listener/viewer feel they are hearing an \r\n         ad as opposed to a PSA?\r\n\r\n              If the answer to any of those is "yes" that doesn\'t \r\n         necessarily mean it is not a PSA.  Chances are, though, it \r\n         won\'t qualify.\r\n\r\n              PSAs have much in common with News Releases in that they \r\n         will'b' include Who, What, When, and Where, but might not have a \r\n         Why.  If there is a cost involved, that needs to be included \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         as well.\r\n\r\n              PSAs will normally be sent to the PSA Director at Radio \r\n         and TV stations.  PSAs sent to Newspapers can usually be sent \r\n         to the Editor, who will know which department to send it to.\r\n\r\n              Many PSAs can be sent on 'b"a postcard.  The file PR- \r\n         SAMP.TXT has a sample PSA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               News Conferences\r\n\r\n              My first thought on holding a News Conference is not to \r\n         hold one.  Unless you have something of extreme importance or \r\n         of a compelling nature, a News Conference probably won't be \r\n         necessary.\r\n\r\n              There are only two reasons I can think of for a BBS to \r\n         hold a News Conference.  One is when a BBS is launched, but \r\n         ev"b'en that is of marginal news value. The other is Crisis \r\n         Management.\r\n\r\n              Whichever the case may be, you need to be fully \r\n         prepared.  Have copies of your statement and support \r\n         materials available to distribute to members of the media \r\n         that attend.\r\n\r\n              If I am hesitant to recommend a News Conference, I am \r\n         adamantly against a Sysop holding a question and answer \r\n         session only.  If you have a News Conference, you had better \r\n'b'         have something specific to say or you are going to alienate \r\n         those attending.  \r\n\r\n              Although it is acceptable to read directly from your \r\n         printed statement during your News Conference, you need to \r\n         practice it several times beforehand so you are completely \r\n         familiar with it.  You might even want to practice the entire \r\n         News Conference.  This can be accomplished by having some \r\n         friends or business associates listen to your stat'b'ement and \r\n         grill you afterword.  Chances are many of the same questions \r\n         a reporter will ask will be asked by this "practice group."\r\n\r\n              Why do you need to answer questions following your \r\n         statement?  There may be something in your statement that was \r\n         unclear, or maybe needed to be expanded.  Sometimes you might \r\n         even be asked to repeat certain sections.  But when things \r\n         appear to be slowing down, don\'t be afraid to call an end to \r\n 'b"        the News Conference.  Make yourself available for individual \r\n         interviews following the News Conference.  TV or radio \r\n         stations might want a more intimate sounding discussion of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 13\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         what the News Conference was about instead of the formal \r\n         statement.  A reporter might have a question he/she didn't \r\n         want to ask in a group setting.\r\n\r\n              Your Ne"b"ws Conference will be competing with all the \r\n         other news events going on throughout the day.  Don't waste \r\n         time and don't expect everyone invited to attend.  I've found \r\n         early afternoon or mid morning to be the best times to hold \r\n         News Conferences.\r\n\r\n              News Conferences can be a very productive method of \r\n         getting your message across.  But they are also quite \r\n         misused.  Hold a News Conference only if you feel the need is \r\n         absol"b'utely imperative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                             \xb3Handling the Media?\n                             \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n              Timeliness is a very important factor when sending \r\n         material to the media.  \r\n\r\n              Most News Releases that are not dated can be mailed at \r\n         any time.  If they are going to be for release on a specific \r\n         date, they should be mailed one to two weeks before the date.  \r\n         P'b'ublic Service Announcements and Event Schedules should be \r\n         sent two to four weeks before the event.\r\n\r\n              This gives the media plenty of time to schedule \r\n         reporters and other resources.\r\n\r\n              I do not recommend calling an Editor or reporter asking \r\n         when your News Release or PSA will be published or aired.  \r\n         They might consider this badgering.  However, you might call \r\n         and ask if they received it and had any questions.  That \r\n         d'b"oesn't guarantee that it will be used, but it might increase \r\n         its chances, and you might even find out when it would be \r\n         used.\r\n\r\n              The Media is not the enemy.  When you are talking with a \r\n         reporter or a group of reporters there is no need to be \r\n         nervous.  Be friendly but professional.  Treat them as you \r\n         would your co-workers.\r\n\r\n              Generally, be calm but assertive.  You have the \r\n         information they want.  Because computer com"b'munications is \r\n         still a burgeoning field, reporters may ask what you think \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 14\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         are dumb or inconsequential questions.  Just answer them \r\n         patiently.  Offer information you think is pertinent to the \r\n         issue.  The more facts they have the more accurate the story \r\n         will be.\r\n\r\n              If you read, see or hear a news story that you feel was \r\n         unfair in 'b"its coverage of the BBS Community, don't be afraid \r\n         to call or write the Editor or News Director and complain \r\n         about it.  Don't be angry, but point out what you feel was \r\n         unfair.  The worst thing you can do is get into an argument \r\n         with a member of the media.  Any headway you've made \r\n         previously can be destroyed.  You are more likely to be \r\n         listened to by being candid but keeping your head on your \r\n         shoulders.  They might make a retraction"b" to the offending \r\n         story or offer you the opportunity to set the record \r\n         straight.  If nothing else, you got it off your chest.\r\n\r\n              Video cameras are so ubiquitous these days that you \r\n         shouldn't give them a second thought.  You should be aware of \r\n         their presence though.  A dark sport jacket with a light \r\n         colored shirt works best on camera.  Flashy or very colorful \r\n         clothes can be very distracting.  The viewer might pay more \r\n         "b"attention to what you are wearing than what you are saying.\r\n\r\n              Never, ever, at any time knowingly tell a falsehood.  \r\n         You'll be caught and you'll be hung out to dry.  If you say \r\n         something that later turns out to be incorrect, then you can \r\n         honestly admit your mistake.  In addition, if there is \r\n         something you don't know, admit that also.  It's always \r\n         better to admit a lack of knowledge than it is to dance \r\n         around a question with a ps"b'eudo-answer.  You can always look \r\n         up the correct answer and call the reporter later.\r\n\r\n              Drawing on that same theme, if you have gotten into a \r\n         situation in which you feel you have gotten in over your \r\n         head, defer the issue to someone you feel comfortable has the \r\n         proper skills and knowledge.  In most cases, a reporter will \r\n         accept your suggested replacement.  The only time it might \r\n         not work is when the reporter is asking about somet'b'hing that \r\n         directly impacts you or your BBS.  \r\n\r\n              This may seem obvious, but you should return calls \r\n         promptly.  Reporters are always under some sort of deadline \r\n         pressure.  The sooner you can return their calls, the more \r\n         they will appreciate you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 15\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                               \xb3Market Research'b"?\n                               \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n              Who needs to do Market Research?  You do.  The days of \r\n         opening up a BBS with a few file areas and some message bases \r\n         are numbered.  Successful BBSs will be those that plan \r\n         carefully with an eye toward what users really want-- not the \r\n         desires of the noisy few.\r\n\r\n              While online questionnaires are quite useful, they often \r\n         don't go far enough or have a large enough base for you "b"to \r\n         make long term decisions.  The biggest problems are low \r\n         response rates and questions that answer themselves.  Very few \r\n         online surveys that I've seen provide enough qualitative \r\n         information for anything other than short term planning.\r\n\r\n              If you are planning on pulling in some new message \r\n         bases, but want to know which ones will actually be read by \r\n         users, then online questionnaires are quite sufficient for the \r\n         job.  Bu"b't if you plan on opening a new BBS, a major change in \r\n         image or thrust, or becoming a larger player in the BBS \r\n         community you probably need to do more than question your \r\n         active users.\r\n\r\n              But there are still times in which you must simply go \r\n         with your visceral instincts.  If you have just done the most \r\n         extensive survey in the history of the industry, you may just \r\n         have to do what your gut tells you to do, even if it is in \r\n        'b" total disagreement with what the research says you should do.\r\n\r\n              The easiest, least expensive, and probably the most \r\n         effective research for BBSs to do is call-out research.  Pick \r\n         up the phone and start dialing.  But you must have a method.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Creating a Survey\r\n\r\n              Depending on what you want to find out, you'll want to \r\n         angle your research in different directions.  A person \r\n         setting up a new BBS is going to"b" need information different \r\n         from that an established Sysop would need to consider whether \r\n         to expand or add services.\r\n\r\n              For our purposes, let's assume you want to do some basic \r\n         research on the group of people that use modems.  To make \r\n         things as easy as possible, we'll assume you will be \r\n         conducting 100 surveys.  This does NOT include people who \r\n         hang up on you or you terminate because they do not fit the \r\n         demographic pro"b"file you are looking for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 16\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              The first thing you'll need to determine is the \r\n         demographic breakdown in your community as a whole.  What is \r\n         the percentage of men and women and their age groups?  This \r\n         information can easily be found at your local library.  Use \r\n         the most recent census data available.  Take those \r\n         percentages in each age/sex demo a"b"nd conduct the same number \r\n         of surveys (23% women aged 25 to 32 in your community, then \r\n         23 surveys with women in that age group).\r\n\r\n              The first thing you need in the survey is a set of \r\n         Terminal questions.  These questions help you determine the \r\n         age and sex groups you need, whether they own computers, \r\n         whether they own modems and how often they use modems.  If \r\n         they don't answer any of the questions in the appropriate \r\n         mann"b'er, you break off the interview.  These people are NOT \r\n         included as part of your 100 completed surveys.\r\n\r\n              If you want an overview of the BBS community compared to \r\n         the community as a whole, you will need to keep track of the \r\n         people that are terminated.\r\n\r\n              Since we are developing a profile on the modem using \r\n         public in your community, we need a set of questions to \r\n         determine how often they use them and in what manner.  We \r\n     'b'    then need some questions to find out what services they use, \r\n         what activities they participate in, and what they might see \r\n         as any shortcomings. \r\n\r\n         Finally, some questions on their hardware and software.\r\n\r\n              All these numbers can be inserted into a spreadsheet \r\n         program.  From there you can make pie charts or bar graphs to \r\n         represent just about anything and help you make planning \r\n         decisions.\r\n\r\n         There is a sample survey in t'b'he BBS-SAMP.TXT file.\r\n\r\n              Here are some terms that are in the sample survey that \r\n         you might want to know:\r\n\r\n              PROMPT-- Ask about listed items.  Subject may offer one \r\n         or more.\r\n              QUERY-- Ask for more, do NOT specify.  Ask "Anything \r\n         else?" and write down responses\r\n              (see XX)-- Depending on response to a question, then go \r\n         to the question with that number (eg: see 5B)\r\n              SPECIFY-- Subject may offer an answe'b"r.  If not, ask.\r\n              TERMINATE-- Bring to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Making the Call\r\n\r\n              You don't need to buy a list in order to make call out \r\n         research.  All it takes is a phone book or city directory.  \r\n         City directories are helpful in that they will have phone \r\n         numbers and addresses that may not be in the phone book.  \r\n         City"b' directories are also expensive, especially when compared \r\n         to that phone book you received when you ordered a phone \r\n         line.\r\n\r\n              Starting with the first residential listing, keep \r\n         dialing down the column until you are able to get a completed \r\n         survey.  Skip the rest of that column, next column and start \r\n         at the top of the following.\r\n\r\n              For example, if you have a three column phone book (most \r\n         are), you get a completed survey'b' on the tenth call in the \r\n         second column.  Skip the remainder of the second column, skip \r\n         the third column, and then start again at the top of the \r\n         first column on the second page.  This will give you a fairly \r\n         random sample.\r\n\r\n              Also make sure you do not purposely call business \r\n         numbers.  Businesses get irritated when people make \r\n         unsolicited calls.  Many individuals do as well.  Expect a \r\n         lot of people to hang up on you.\r\n\r'b'\n              ALWAYS thank the person at the end of the interview, \r\n         even if you terminate them after the first question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                              \xb3Crisis Management?\n                              \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n              The first thing to remember about Crisis Management is \r\n         to avoid creating one.  That isn\'t always possible.  In that \r\n         case, the second thing to remember is "Don\'t Panic."  You \r\n         'b"simply don't have time.  Always keep your head.\r\n\r\n              It's quite unlikely BBSs will be responsible for \r\n         volcanic eruptions or toxic waste dumps.  Most crisis a BBS \r\n         would be involved in are legal in nature.  If that's the \r\n         case, you'll need to contact your attorney at once.\r\n\r\n              In fact, you might even want to consider keeping one on \r\n         retainer or having a pre-paid legal plan.  Your attorney \r\n         should be familiar with communications law a"b'nd First \r\n         Amendment Issues.  Your local Bar Association should be able \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 18\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         to help you find one.\r\n\r\n              The media has easier access to prosecutors than to \r\n         defendants.  That is why in most criminal cases it appears a \r\n         suspect has already been convicted and hauled off even though \r\n         the case has not yet been brought to trial.  The good news is \r\n        'b" that more defense attorneys are becoming media savvy and are \r\n         willing to make statements to reporters.\r\n\r\n              Most of the time, the best thing to do is to let your \r\n         attorney do your talking for you.  Among other things, that's \r\n         what you are paying him for.  He will know what can and \r\n         cannot be said in public and is in a better position to deal \r\n         with legal intricacies that may come up.\r\n\r\n              For now, the online community tends to rally a"b'round BBS \r\n         operators who have been accused of improprieties.  Unless \r\n         your counselor objects, you can begin drumming up support \r\n         from within the industry.  Among other things, you can make \r\n         legal documents available in computer readable form.  Contact \r\n         industry magazines such as BOARDWATCH, BBS CALLERS DIGEST and \r\n         CONNECT and let them know what is happening.  But you should \r\n         always advise or consult your attorney before doing any of \r\n   'b"      this.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Friendly Faces\r\n\r\n              I've made this point before and I'll make it again.  \r\n         Reporters assigned to cover a story involving BBSs or other \r\n         online services may not fully understand the industry.  Some \r\n         of them may even be technophobes.\r\n\r\n              With that in mind, there is another position you can \r\n         work yourself into.  That is the position of the Local \r\n         Expert.  For sake of example, another Sysop"b' has run into \r\n         trouble with the law.  You could make yourself available to \r\n         help explain what some of those complicated technological \r\n         terms are all about, making sure you stay clear of the legal \r\n         issues involved.  You may not get your face on TV or your \r\n         name printed in the paper, but you will be providing a \r\n         valuable service to your local media.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              The First Amendment\r\n                                    at Risk\r\n\r'b"\n              The online community is under attack.  There are many \r\n         in government who apparently believe First Amendment freedoms \r\n         should not be extended to BBSs and other online services, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 19\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         even if they don't explicitly state this.  The Clipper chip \r\n         is just one example.\r\n\r\n              The battle lines are being drawn in the courts and in \r\n         the mainstream"b' media.  Solid wins in the justice system will \r\n         help ensure a place for the First Amendment in the future.  \r\n         Diligent and deft manipulation of the media will help ensure \r\n         public support for the online community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                               \xb3Out of the Box?\n                               \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n              Many Sysops set up a BBS in a cloistered room, hunch \r\n         over a brightly lit screen late at ni'b'ght tweaking here and \r\n         tweaking there.  "Heh!" they think, "this new door game will \r\n         bring me a few more callers!"\r\n\r\n              Wrong.\r\n\r\n              You can be assured that new game is A) already on \r\n         another BBS in town, B) the potential new callers won\'t know \r\n         for sometime that you have it or C) potential new callers \r\n         won\'t care that you have it.\r\n\r\n              The game can wait \'til tomorrow.  Do something that is \r\n         more likely to bring i'b"n potential callers to your BBS in \r\n         particular and into the BBS community generally.  Get out of \r\n         the house.\r\n\r\n              Chances are your BBS or the local BBS or Sysops' \r\n         Association sponsors a picnic or some such at least once a \r\n         year.  Although this is a good idea, it usually is a \r\n         gathering a modem users.  You need to become more involved \r\n         with the community as a whole.\r\n\r\n              There are many, many opportunities to create a good \r\n"b'         public relations image within the community.  Even though the \r\n         mainstream media should be a part of your public relations \r\n         efforts, you do not have to rely on them to tell your \r\n         message.\r\n\r\n              Your local Chamber of Commerce probably has some sort of \r\n         monthly or annual list of events going on in the community.  \r\n         There should be several that you can attend or co-sponsor on \r\n         behalf of the BBS.  You can also make yourself available 'b"to \r\n         talk to Service Clubs and Youth Groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Have you thought of conducting a seminar?  Let's face \r\n         it, BBSs are not among the easiest computer applications to \r\n         use.  You could teach users and potential users about \r\n         telecommunications and BBSing.  With more and more BBSs \r\n         connecting to the Internet, a seminar on how to use the \r\n         Inte"b'rnet could be quite valuable.  As an aside, you might \r\n         even be able to bring in a few bucks by conducting seminars.\r\n\r\n              Schools are another place to make your mark.  Donate \r\n         your time to teach a class or be a guest in a class.  You \r\n         might even consider donating your old equipment to an \r\n         elementary school when you upgrade to newer equipment.  That \r\n         might even bring you some good press coverage.\r\n\r\n              If you have a laptop or an older co'b"mputer you wouldn't \r\n         mind toting around, take it with you with a scaled down \r\n         version of your BBS to show people what it looks like.  Very \r\n         few things work better than a good visual aid.  \r\n\r\n              If you produce a newsletter for your BBS that is mailed \r\n         to users on a regular basis, add the local media outlets to \r\n         your mailing list.  Just as with News Releases, most \r\n         newsletters will be thrown out.  But sometimes someone will \r\n         gra"b"b an idea from one and produce a story from it.  By golly, \r\n         you'll probably be the first person they call.\r\n\r\n              Everyday thousands of cars go past yours or you pass \r\n         them.  Bumper stickers are moving billboards.  Make them \r\n         available anytime you are out meeting the public.  Because \r\n         you must make a quick impression, just have the name of your \r\n         BBS and the data phone number printed on them.\r\n\r\n              Coffee mugs and t-shirts are good promot"b'ional items that \r\n         can also bring in some money.  Sale items such as those are \r\n         really best for larger commercial systems, though.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                               \xb3Final Comments?\n                               \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n              I am quite conscience of the fact that I did not discuss \r\n         paid advertising in this manual.

The Internet is a worldwide \r\n         network connecting Universities, Research Centers, Government \r\n         and Business with electronic mail, news, public message \r\n         bases, and computer programs.\r\n\r\n              This is the first time the Internet has been publicly \r\n         available in the Fort Smith area.  System Operator of \r'b'\n         Aphelion BBS, Robert Parson, says "The heart of computing is \r\n         being able to share information.  Now users in Fort Smith can \r\n         easily share information with the world and gather \r\n         information from sources they couldn\'t reach before."\r\n\r\n              Aphelion BBS will provide a free Electronic Mailbox to \r\n         anyone wishing to receive private messages.

It states the facts with few embellishments.  The \r\n         next news release is a bit more complicated since it starts \r\n         with a softer lead, or beginning.

It takes time, practice and \r\n         instruction.  The Internet is, if not the largest, one the \r'b'\n         largest computer oceans.\r\n\r\n              Aphelion Computer Bulletin Board System is sponsoring a \r\n         seminar designed to help computer users learn to navigate \r\n         through the Internet.  "This seminar will focus on Electronic \r\n         mail addressing and file transfers," according to System \r\n         Operator Robert Parson.  More seminars dealing with other \r\n         aspects of the Internet are planned.\r\n\r\n              The Seminar will be held Saturday, October 9 at 1:00p.m. \r\n 'b'        at the Fort Smith Public Library.

The \r\n         charge for the seminar was included since it was necessary, \r\n         but it was buried deep in the news release.\r\n\r\n              If you'"b"ll notice, both of these news releases have a \r\n         contact name and number.

But as the raid proved, I was apparently \r\n         wrong.\r\n\r\n              Yes, the PFLRM is working toward separation from the \r\n         Nation of Cellophane Tape.

Whether you \r\n         have a 32 line commercial BBS, a single line hobby board or \r\n         somewhere in between, you are selling a service.  Just as \r\n         with any other product, you have to d'b'ecide where and how your \r\n         public relations efforts should best be spent.  \r\n\r\n              Now may be a good time to look at your BBS and take an \r\n         inventory.  The Inventory included at the beginning of this \r\n         file will help you take stock of the strengths and weaknesses \r\n         of your BBS.  Some of these things you may already have \r\n         thought of.  Others possibly not.  Whatever the case may be, \r\n         this is a very subjective matter and there are no right or \r\n'b'         wrong answers.\r\n\r\n              We\'ll take this step by step and briefly examine some of \r\n         the immediate public relations problems your BBS may present \r\n         and some ways to solve those problems.\r\n\r\n              I want you to bear in mind that it is NOT my intention \r\n         to tell you how to run your BBS.  In addition, I don\'t think \r\n         there are any "bad" features for a BBS, except of course \r\n         those that are patently illegal.  If anything like that is \r\n        'b' implied, it wasn\'t intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n         BBS NAME:\r\n\r\n              The name of your BBS should be chosen very carefully and \r\n         it should be in keeping with the overall tone of the BBS.  \r\n         Chances are you wouldn\'t want to call your BBS "Thunder of \r\n         Cloven Hooves" if the emphasis is on scholarly Biblical \r\n         discussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Sysop:\r\n\r\n              If you are known to users mainly as the Sysop, that \r\n         could be creating an aloof image.  That could be the'b" image \r\n         you want.  On some larger boards with staffs that may be the \r\n         best way to handle administrative duties.  But if you want to \r\n         have a more folksy and personable board you need to make \r\n         yourself known.  Create an account with your name, if you \r\n         haven't already done so.  Encourage users to refer to you \r\n         with your name, instead of The Sysop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    YOUR PRODUCT pg 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r"b'\n                    General Interest/Special Focus\r\n\r\n              You may want to have a BBS with a little bit of \r\n         everything for everybody.  Even with cable becoming more \r\n         prevalent, the three major broadcast networks still have the \r\n         largest viewership.  A General Interest BBS with a very large \r\n         plate to offer will draw users but could overwhelm some \r\n         users, especially new users.  \r\n\r\n              A BBS with a specific interest runs the risk of being \r\n'b"         too narrowly defined.  There is probably a market for a BBS \r\n         about horse racing jockeys six feet and taller with green \r\n         eyes, but it's also so specialized it would attract few \r\n         callers (if any).\r\n\r\n\r\n         Users\r\n\r\n              Most BBS have very large user lists.  Many of those \r\n         lists are bogus in that they reflect all the people that have \r\n         visited since the BBS was established.  Some Sysops routinely \r\n         clean the chaff out of the user "b"lists.  This is a good idea \r\n         in that it makes it easier for Sysops to keep track of who is \r\n         active and who is not.  In addition it helps users who log in \r\n         only occasionally.  If a user hasn't logged on recently he \r\n         has usually lost track of what happened the last time he was \r\n         on.  It reminds occasional users that it might be a good idea \r\n         to stop in more often.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Money:\r\n\r\n              As I'm sure you are aware, a Bulletin Board can cos"b't a \r\n         lot to operate.  The trend is to charge some kind of \r\n         subscription.  There are a number of different ways in which \r\n         to do this.  A very large portion of the BBS community \r\n         believes that charging for access violates the spirit of \r\n         freedom of information that has been intertwined with \r\n         personal computers since their introduction.  You will face \r\n         that sort of resistance, especially if your BBS has had a \r\n         history of access at n'b'o charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n         FILES:\r\n\r\n              File areas are arguably the heart of a BBS.  And just as \r\n         with a human heart, they can create a huge amount of trouble \r\n         if not properly taken care of.    \r\n\r\n              File Requests can be a valuable promotional tool.  Many \r\n         software companies allow potential buyers to request a demo \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     YOUR PRODUCT pg 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         from their support board to try th'b"e software before \r\n         purchasing it.  Some BBSs allow downloads of certain \r\n         informational files without having the caller registered or \r\n         verified.  This is potentially a very powerful feature and \r\n         probably should be implemented on your BBS if it isn't \r\n         already.  A file explaining your policies, the message bases \r\n         available, some hints on how to use your BBS (especially if \r\n         it uses a less well known software package), and maybe even a \r\n     "b"    registration or subscription form.  This gives the user an \r\n         idea of what your BBS is like and can leave him with a good \r\n         feeling in that he received something without having full \r\n         access.\r\n\r\n              BBSs are commonly cited as a major source of computer \r\n         viruses.  If you take great pains to check all files for \r\n         viruses before making them publicly available then you can \r\n         put many users' minds at ease.  Make sure you promote that \r\n         "b'often on your BBS and in any advertising you do.  Sometimes a \r\n         virus will sneak through even the best virus checkers.  Track \r\n         down the offending file, delete it and apologize to those who \r\n         downloaded it.  But gently remind users that you are not \r\n         responsible for damage caused by the virus.  They downloaded \r\n         and used it at their own risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Message Bases:\r\n\r\n              If File Areas are the heart of a BBS, then the Message \r\n         Bases are 'b'the soul of your BBS.  That is where your users \r\n         have the biggest opportunity to contribute to the board.  \r\n         This is also where you have the biggest opportunity to set \r\n         the image of the BBS.  Your message bases can be wide and \r\n         varied or narrow and focused on just a few topics.  Keep in \r\n         mind not everyone is going to be tactful and considerate.  \r\n         Some are rude and downright mean.\r\n\r\n              Nationally echoed message bases can be a valuable ass'b"et \r\n         to your board.  But there will be times when there are \r\n         matters of interest in Waxahachie, Texas that folks in Erie, \r\n         Pennsylvania won't be interested in.  Chances are you have at \r\n         least one message base that is specific for local matters.  \r\n         You may want to consider opening up a few others depending on \r\n         the demand from your users.     \r\n\r\n\r\n         DOORS:\r\n\r\n              Your choice of Door programs create a twofold public \r\n         relation"b"s challenge right out of the box.  First, there may \r\n         be times in which you add a door that doesn't quite fit the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     YOUR PRODUCT pg 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         image you are trying to create on your BBS.  In that case \r\n         it's a fairly simple matter to remove the door program.  \r\n         Second, a very popular door could tie up your BBS for hours a \r\n         day with just a few users, causing frustration to others.  \r\n     "b'    This is particularly true of games.  \r\n\r\n\r\n         MISC:\r\n\r\n              Most BBSs run a screen full of Bulletins when the user \r\n         logs on.  These bulletins should be updated as often as \r\n         possible.  Callers need to know what\'s going on with your \r\n         BBS, even if it\'s just the latest scores for "Red Dragon."  \r\n         Most users don\'t read the bulletins on a regular basis.  But, \r\n         they leave the impression that you have a "happening" BBS.  A \r\n         business owner'b' I once worked for said to me "The impression \r\n         that we have business generates business."  He always made \r\n         sure there were cars in front of his business, even if they \r\n         belonged to employees.  Your bulletins can be the cars in \r\n         front of your business.  \r\n\r\n              Curiously, though, a lot of bulletins can also turn away \r\n         a user.  If you have a potload of bulletins, you might want \r\n         to think about moving some to areas in which they are more \r\n  'b'       appropriate.  Bulletins of game scores might be moved to a \r\n         gaming conference, as an example.  Rules, policies and news \r\n         should be the primary considerations when developing log on \r\n         bulletins.  \r\n\r\n              There are several BBS and Sysop groups and associations \r\n         that you can become a member of.  There might even be one or \r\n         more in your area.  They are sources of support, solutions, \r\n         and other information.  If you are having trouble wit'b'h \r\n         another sysop, the association can be a place to arbitrate \r\n         your difficulties.  If worse comes to worse and you run afoul \r\n         of the law as a result of your BBS, the group may be able to \r\n         put you in touch with some legal help.\r\n\r\n              A meeting can also provide you with the opportunity to \r\n         unwind after a hard day of slaving over a hot keyboard.  I \r\n         strongly recommend joining a group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           'b"                          YOUR PRODUCT pg 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                                \xb3GOAL SETTING?\n                                \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n              Even if you don't run a commercial BBS, you should think \r\n         of it as a business.  There is hardly any business that does \r\n         not take an inventory on a regular basis.   Any business that \r\n         does not analyze itself occasionally is doomed to failure.\r\n\r\n           "b"   Every six months or so, sit back and look at where your \r\n         BBS has been, where it's at and where it's going.  Do you \r\n         have specific goals in mind?  What are you doing to meet \r\n         those goals?  How is your Public Relations campaign \r\n         reflecting the climb toward those goals?\r\n\r\n              Whatever you are up to, PROMOTE, PROMOTE, PROMOTE.  Tell \r\n         your users what's going on.  Tell your co-workers.  Tell the \r\n         dog.  Get the word out on the street somehow"b'.  \r\n\r\n              This is only a cursory look at some the things you \r\n         should be aware of from a public relations standpoint as you \r\n         examine your BBS.

First, that image was tarnished by \r\n         stories of pirated software, then by stories of viruses and \r\n         most recently the rash of stories involving pedophiles using \r\n         BBSs to further their illegal activity (child pornography).\r\n\r\n              This guide is not intended to be the final word on \r\n         public relations for BBSs.  So'b"meone is always coming up with \r\n         a new idea or putting a new spin on an old one.  This is just \r\n         a basic guide with some general rules of thumb you can use to \r\n         enhance the image of your BBS.  Keep in mind that there will \r\n         likely be some things in here that you disagree with.  In \r\n         that case, I'd like you to write to me, state your case, and \r\n         maybe you can persuade me to see things differently.  \r\n\r\n              In addition, I am not an attorney, cann"b'ot provide legal \r\n         advice, and this is not intended to be a legal guide.

That in itself is the single biggest \r\n         Public Relations problem a Sysop faces.  BBS users, \r\n         obviously, fall somewhere in the remaining 45 percent.  \r\n\r\n              Those who fear technology are the ones that are the most \r\n         difficult to explain electronic communications to.  They may \r\n         see compute'b'rs as taking over their lives.  There are chips in \r\n         their cars, in their microwaves, in their stereos, and in \r\n         their VCRS.  Computers send them their utility bills, credit \r\n         card bills, track their income tax payments, and note when \r\n         their daughter is born.\r\n\r\n              Those in that 55 percent are not necessarily \r\n         technophobic.  Most of them are just technologically \r\n         disinterested.  These are the people that we should be most \r\n         concern'b"ed with from a Public Relations standpoint.  What they \r\n         know about computers, modems and BBSs comes from the \r\n         mainstream media.  A reporter assigned to a story about BBSs \r\n         may or may not fully understand what they are reporting on.\r\n\r\n              The remaining 45 percent includes you and me, the expert \r\n         user, the average user and the novice user.  This group \r\n         doesn't need quite as much public relations massaging since \r\n         it already knows the benefi"b'ts of using a modem to connect \r\n         with other people.\r\n\r\n              People that were overwhelmed when they first called a \r\n         BBS and decided it was too tough to try again also fall into \r\n         that 45 percent.  They have computers, they may be \r\n         technically adept, they can probably even program a VCR.  But \r\n         the mysteries of 8-N-1 elude them.  In addition, there are \r\n         those who were at one time active in the BBS community, but \r\n         are no longer involve'b"d.  Maybe they had a falling out with a \r\n         Sysop or another user.  These are both disaffected users\r\n\r\n              There is also the group of people that have modems \r\n         because it came with their computer but they have not used \r\n         it.   Some because they don't know they have one, some \r\n         because they aren't interested in using it.\r\n\r\n              How can you distill all these diverse groups into one \r\n         simple Public Relations campaign?  Simply put, you can't.\r\n\r\n\r\n"b'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   The Media\r\n\r\n              News can be defined broadly as something that is out of \r\n         the ordinary (such as a murder) or something that is a matter \r\n         of public record (such as a City Council meeting).  \r\n         Generally, though, news is a change in the status quo.\r\n\r\n              Many people get upset over what is perceived as a \r\n         liberal or con'b'servative slant in the news.  Because both \r\n         sides get upset about slanted news, that indicates to me that \r\n         most media coverage is unbiased or at least politically \r\n         moderate.  So-called objective reporting is a relatively \r\n         recent invention.  Before the American Civil War, most \r\n         newspapers were just a cut above political tracts.  But \r\n         journalism history and theory is not our topic.\r\n\r\n              Most stories involving BBSs involve a crime that has'b" \r\n         been committed, usually pirated software, viruses, or \r\n         pornography.  Even though one BBS may be raided for \r\n         improprieties, it reflects poorly on the entire BBS community \r\n         by guilt through association.  This is similar to many \r\n         American's mistrust of all Arabs due to the misdeeds of a \r\n         few, as an example.  It isn't fair, it isn't right, but it's \r\n         The Way Things Are.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                 "b"             \xb3Finding the Media?\n                              \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n              The easiest way to find out who you need to talk to or \r\n         write to is by looking in the phone book.  All the TV and \r\n         Radio stations and Newspapers will be listed under those \r\n         categories.  You might want to also look for Magazines and \r\n         News Services.\r\n\r\n              A phone call can uncover a lot of information.  You will \r\n         need the media outlet's voice number, fa"b'x number, address and \r\n         the person to talk to or send mailings to.\r\n\r\n              Your best luck in the Public Relations arena is going to \r\n         be in the local media.  Remember that not all your public \r\n         relations efforts are going to be successful.  For instance, \r\n         most News Releases are thrown in the trash.  But if you keep \r\n         at it your efforts will pay off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'b"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Newspaper\r\n\r\n              Because of the rise of electronic information \r\n         distribution, many people have predicted the demise of \r\n         newspapers.  That's unlikely, at least for the next fifty to \r\n         one hundred years.  Yes, readership has declined.  \r\n         Newspapers, though, are chameleons and are able to adapt.  \r\n         Thirty years ago most newspapers looked like the New York \r\n         Times.  Most newspapers now have much more open "b'and \r\n         "friendly" looks.  \r\n\r\n              They are also the most powerful of all the media.  No \r\n         other media shapes and forms public opinion to the degree \r\n         newspapers do.  This is usually because they have larger news \r\n         staffs and much longer traditions than broadcast media.  \r\n         Print also has a permanence that broadcast does not have.    \r\n\r\n              As a Sysop, your Public Relations efforts should start \r\n         with the Editor or City Editor, whicheve'b'r the case may be.  \r\n         These Editors will assign stories to a reporter.\r\n\r\n              You may be tempted to change your mailing list to a \r\n         certain reporter.  Although this may seem like a good idea, \r\n         reporters tend to change jobs on a fairly regular basis (this \r\n         is especially the case in broadcast media).  You might opt to \r\n         add a reporter to your list, but make sure you continue to \r\n         send material to the Editor.\r\n\r\n              I do not recommend 'b'offering to write a column.  You will \r\n         run out of things to write about much sooner than you think.  \r\n         Not only that, newspapers have access to syndicated columns \r\n         that may not deal specifically with BBSs, but will touch on \r\n         them occasionally.  \r\n\r\n              The opinion page provides several opportunities to get \r\n         your name and the name of your BBS out.  The Letters to the \r\n         Editor section can be quite effective in telling your \r\n         message.'b'  You might even be asked occasionally to write a \r\n         guest opinion.  Use those opportunities whenever possible, \r\n         but be wary of writing too many Letters to the Editor.  If \r\n         they get printed often, you will lose your impact and become \r\n         just another shrill voice on the opinion page.\r\n\r\n              News about computers and computer technology tends to \r\n         become lodged in the Business section of a newspaper.  If \r\n         your paper has one, you need to put the B'b'usiness Editor on \r\n         your mailing list.\r\n\r\n             Be careful with multiple mailings to newspapers.  If you \r\n         have a News Conference, you could have several people from         \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         one newspaper there.  There are few things that annoy editors \r\n         more than finding out that the paper had "overstaffed" a news \r\n         conference.  It might be wise to note on the announcem'b'ent the \r\n         departments or individuals that are getting copies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Television\r\n\r\n              Television thrives on good video.  Too often, a story \r\n         with good video will override a good story with no video.  \r\n         That is part of the reason why even though nearly everyone \r\n         watches tv news, hardly anyone trusts it.  Despite that, \r\n         television can get your message across to more people in a \r\n         shorter period of time.\r\n\r\n    'b'          Assignment Editors are the people that tell the \r\n         reporters what stories they will tell that day.  Most of your \r\n         productive work with tv stations will be with the Assignment \r\n         Editor.  Assignment Editors work with the Producer, and both \r\n         are supervised by the News Director.\r\n\r\n              Should you be lucky and they are interested in doing a \r\n         story about the current state of art in BBS technology, \r\n         remember that you need to make yourself'b" visually compelling.  \r\n         Show lots of activity on the screen, blinking on the modem, \r\n         the tangle of wires for the phone lines.  \r\n\r\n              Present yourself as a business professional, even if you \r\n         are operating a one-line, non-commercial system.  That \r\n         doesn't necessarily mean you need to wear a suit and tie, \r\n         although that would be a good idea.\r\n\r\n              BBSs have become the whipping boy of tv news during the \r\n         past year.  Sex and Porn"b'ography are probably the topics they \r\n         will be most interested in, especially child pornography.  If \r\n         you are called out of the blue someday by a tv reporter \r\n         wishing to do an interview, those are the likely topics.  Be \r\n         prepared to dodge bullets.  \r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Radio\r\n\r\n              Radio Journalism is a dying art.  There was once a time \r\n         when no radio station would even think of not having a news \r\n         department.  Now man'b"y stations have only a morning newsperson \r\n         that rewrites the morning paper, and they might not have even \r\n         that.  It's very tragic.\r\n\r\n              But there are still a very good number of radio stations \r\n         with active news departments.  For the most part, you will \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         deal directly with the News Director.  Some larger stations \r\n         may also have an Assignments Edit"b'or.\r\n\r\n              Radio stations will be looking for stories that can be \r\n         told very quickly and have good "sound."  Normally, a radio \r\n         reporter will simply be seeking an interview.  But there may \r\n         be an occasion in which a reporter is doing a special report \r\n         or a series.  BBSs don\'t really have much sound to record, \r\n         but there is some.  Modem tones, connection alarms, and ANSI \r\n         music are a few.\r\n\r\n              Because the pace of radio news dep'b'artments is even \r\n         faster than tv, believe it or not, it won\'t be uncommon for a \r\n         radio reporter to call on the phone to get a comment on a \r\n         breaking story or even a follow-up on a story idea you may \r\n         have presented them with in some correspondence.\r\n\r\n              If you are contacted on a "slow" news day, you and your \r\n         BBS could be included in a number of radio newscasts.  Even \r\n         in music intensive formats, radio news tends to be listener \r\n      'b'   active-- that is listeners pay close attention to the news.\r\n\r\n              News/Talk stations are particularly good targets.  They \r\n         are nearly always looking for good people to interview on the \r\n         air.\r\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                                \xb3Your Product?\n                                \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n                                You are the BBS\r\n\r\n\r\n              First of all, you have to think of your BBS as a \r\n         product.  'b"Whether you have a 32 line commercial BBS, a single \r\n         line hobby board or somewhere in between, you are selling a \r\n         service.  Just as with any other product, you have to decide \r\n         where and how your public relations efforts should best be \r\n         spent.  Would you sell Lambroghinis in rural Oklahoma?  You \r\n         can try, but you probably wouldn't sell very many.  And what \r\n         happens when your Lambroghini has a major recall?  How would \r\n         you handle the Public"b" Relations crisis?\r\n\r\n              Now may be a good time to look at your BBS and take an \r\n         inventory.  If you haven't already done so, print the file \r\n         PRODUCT.TXT included with this package.  It will help you \r\n         take stock of the strengths and weaknesses of your BBS.  \r\n\r\n              PRODUCT.TXT examines the inventory and looks at some of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         the immediate public relati"b'ons problems that could occur as a \r\n         direct result of the features of your BBS.  Since this file \r\n         goes into depth about particular items on your BBS that may \r\n         cause some Public Relations problems, we won\'t discuss it in \r\n         detail here, but we will touch on some of the same issues.\r\n\r\n              The first and foremost question you should ask yourself \r\n         is "Why should someone call my BBS?"  To answer that \r\n         question, let\'s create two BBSs to use as exa'b"mples:\r\n\r\n              Beta BBS has message bases, files and a couple games.  \r\n         Delta BBS has message bases, files and a couple games.  \r\n         Nothing really different here.  The Sysop of Beta BBS is an \r\n         active participant in his BBS in that he writes messages on a \r\n         regular basis.  The Delta BBS Sysop turns up on occasion and \r\n         makes an announcement.  Hmmm.  Looks like Beta has a slight \r\n         edge; the Sysop doesn't seem so unreachable.  There is \r\n         no"b'thing wrong with Delta BBS, but it seems so ordinary.  \r\n         There are hundreds of other BBSs using the same software in \r\n         the same manner and it appears the Sysop is an out of state \r\n         landlord.  \r\n\r\n              If there is only one weapon I can give you in your \r\n         Public Relations campaign that weapon would be yourself.  You \r\n         must allow your personality to become a part of the BBS.\r\n\r\n              In this manner BBSs are identical to TV News.  They may \r\n        'b" offer the same plate, but the plate is presented a little \r\n         differently.  You might like the person who does the weather \r\n         more than the other station's weatherblond.  That is why you \r\n         watch Eyewitness News instead of The Newscenter or whatever \r\n         the case may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Graphics\r\n\r\n\r\n              Sometimes a subtle change in the graphics scheme can \r\n         make a big difference in how a user perceives your BBS.  If \r\n         you use"b' a lot of bright,garish colors a caller may get the \r\n         impression that the BBS is loud and brash.  Look closely at \r\n         how TV stations use color.  They generally use two or three \r\n         colors to set the overall graphics image and everything else \r\n         is either based on those colors or is worked into them \r\n         somehow.       \r\n\r\n              You should also examine how your menus are laid out.  \r\n         Your first concern should be whether they make sense.  A \r\n         cal'b"ler shouldn't have to scratch his head trying to figure \r\n         out what he should do next, unless he really has no idea.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Secondly, is the picture busy?  A busy menu page takes \r\n         longer to draw and is harder to read.  If after the screen is \r\n         drawn and you find yourself distracted, chances are your \r\n         layout has too many elements.\r\n\r\n              Graphics artis"b'ts for print publications talk about what \r\n         is called "white space."  That is the amount of nothingness \r\n         that surrounds text and pictures.  The more there is the more \r\n         pleasing to the eye the page is.  There is nothing wrong with \r\n         using a background to support your menus, but it should be \r\n         unobtrusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Making Changes\r\n\r\n              Whenever you change or add something you need to think \r\n         to yourself "Is this som'b'ething that my users need or want?"  \r\n         You also need to think of the image you want your BBS to \r\n         present.  If you have a Science Fiction themed BBS, that new \r\n         CD-ROM of Civil War statistics may not fit in very well.\r\n\r\n              I want to make the point, though, that you might prefer \r\n         to run a BBS that offers something of interest to everyone.  \r\n         But if you do have a thread that runs throughout the entire \r\n         system you need to think twice before ma'b"king a change or an \r\n         addition.  If it doesn't feel right to you then it probably \r\n         won't be kosher with your users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                             \xb3TOOLS OF THE TRADE?\n                             \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n              You have your computer(s), phone lines(s), software, \r\n         message bases, and file areas.  But do you have your \r\n         stationary and business cards?  Unless you are running a \r\n         comm"b"ercial system, you probably don't (and many commercial \r\n         systems don't either).\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Business Cards and Stationary\r\n\r\n              From time to time you'll want to write a letter as the \r\n         Sysop of your BBS.  This letter may be to a user, your city \r\n         officials, your Congressman or even to local media outlets.  \r\n         Your letter will carry more weight if it is on stationary.  \r\n         Make sure it has the name of your BBS, mailing address, voice \r\n  "b"       line and data line.  Your name and title are options since \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         you will be signing it anyway.\r\n\r\n              If you work as a salesperson, an engineer, or any other \r\n         service oriented business, you wouldn't think twice about \r\n         getting business cards.  They are an essential part of your \r\n         business armament.  You hand them to every new person you \r\n         meet duri"b"ng the course of your day.  You should do the same \r\n         for your BBS.  \r\n\r\n              Business cards are an effective way of getting the word \r\n         out about your BBS.  You don't need anything fancy.  Just the \r\n         name of your BBS, your name, your title, a mailing address, \r\n         your voice line and your data line.\r\n\r\n              As for your title, I would recommend System Operator.  \r\n         The average person on the street, including some who claim to \r\n         be computer li"b'terate, may not understand what "Sysop" means.\r\n\r\n              If you have even the slightest reason to write someone \r\n         on BBS stationary, then you should do it.  Always carry some \r\n         BBS business cards with you and pass them out at every \r\n         opportunity.  Stationary and business cards are inexpensive \r\n         and extremely effective.\r\n\r\n              One word of caution, though.  If your BBS is not \r\n         affiliated with your professional career, you need to make \r\n         s'b'ure you keep the two separated.  This can be a problem when \r\n         handing out business cards in particular.  You might be \r\n         tempted to give a client cards from both work and your BBS.  \r\n         Should you do this, the client must be made aware that they \r\n         are two completely separate entities.  Not only that, but \r\n         your boss might not be too keen on the idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Brochures and Fliers\r\n\r\n              Brochures are also good promotional items for'b" BBSs.   \r\n         Although they are not as necessary as business cards and \r\n         stationary, they can be very good tools.  Brochures can be \r\n         left at computer stores, taken to conventions, or used to \r\n         send in response to advertising.\r\n\r\n              Good brochures don't necessarily have to be \r\n         professionally produced, printed on glossy stock paper and \r\n         using four colors.  You can produce an effective brochure \r\n         using a desktop publishing program at hom"b"e.  \r\n\r\n              A brochure should hit on the main points you want to \r\n         make, have some graphics, and entice the reader into calling.  \r\n         A brochure is intended to introduce your product to potential \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         callers.  Don't feel you should fill up the entire brochure \r\n         with a lot of copy.  For one thing, if there's a lot to read, \r\n         most of it won't get read unless "rwndb'it is extremely compelling.  \r\n         The majority of the time, though, simple will suffice.\r\n\r\n              When developing your brochure, you should design it by \r\n         cutting the page in thirds and deciding what needs to be on \r\n         which page.  Obviously, you want the name of the BBS, the \r\n         phone number and maybe a graphic on the front.  You get to \r\n         the nitty gritty of what is on your board inside.  The middle \r\n         section of the outside should be left blank so you 'b'can put an \r\n         address on it.\r\n\r\n              A flier generally is one page, and follows roughly the \r\n         same guidelines as those for a brochure.  In general, though, \r\n         you layout for the entire page instead of in thirds.\r\n\r\n              I mentioned "white space" earlier, and I want to \r\n         emphasize that again, especially in regard to your printed \r\n         materials.  The more white space you have, the more pleasing \r\n         to the eye your layout is.  Of course, that doe'b"sn't mean have \r\n         a blank page with only one sentence on it.  You do need to \r\n         keep your pages from looking cluttered and busy.\r\n\r\n                                Do it yourself\r\n                                      or\r\n                                 hire someone\r\n\r\n              Personal computers have liberated us to do work \r\n         ourselves that we would previously have hired someone to do.  \r\n         That includes personal publishing.  There are a number of \r\n         desktop pu"b'blishing programs available at your friendly \r\n         neighborhood computer store.

For roughly b'ut clean and simple, especially on the \r\n         cards.  If you have a graphic that is used to help identify \r\n         your BBS you should use it.\r\n\r\n              Colored paper and spot color can be very effective.  But \r\n         you need to be very careful.  Your information can be hard to \r\n         read on dark paper.  Spot color is exactly that-- a small \r\n         touch of color to highlight something on the page.  But it \r\n         can be put in the wrong place.\r\n\r\n              A couple things to'b' note about having your work done \r\n         professionally:  colored paper and spot color usually cost \r\n         extra.  The printshop will also likely charge you to have a \r\n         graphic scanned and placed on your stationary or business \r\n         cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n::::::::::::::\nbbs-pr2.txt\n::::::::::::::\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                                \xb3News Products?\n                                \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n                                 News Releases\r\n\r\n     'b'         News Releases can be among the most effective tools you \r\n         use in your public relations efforts.  This may seem hard to \r\n         believe, but much of what we read, hear or see in the news is \r\n         prompted by a news release.  The News Media really does want \r\n         to know what is going on in the community and News Releases \r\n         provide valuable tip-offs for stories.\r\n\r\n              Among other things, News Releases can be used to make \r\n         yourself "The Expert" in th'b'e field.  There is much attention \r\n         being paid in Washington D.C. to the National Data Highway.  \r\n         By making yourself the expert in computer communications, \r\n         local media might contact you for local reaction to a story \r\n         about the National Data Highway or other topics, including \r\n         computer pornography.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              On any given day, a news department can rece'b"ive dozens \r\n         of News Releases.  If you send a News Release to a Newspaper, \r\n         or Radio or TV station, don't assume it will be used.  Lack \r\n         of a local angle, lack of timeliness, and obvious business \r\n         promotion are among the reasons most are thrown away.  The \r\n         biggest portion of those that are thrown out, though, are \r\n         News Releases that are poorly written.\r\n\r\n    \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n    ?

Those are also essential to a News Release.\r\n\r\n              You should also strive for clarity and brevity.  Even if \r\n         you consider yourself a poor'b' writer, if you include all of \r\n         these factors, your News Release will probably be at the very \r\n         least readable.\r\n\r\n              A News Release should have a Headline, a release date \r\n         (even if all it says is FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE), and contact \r\n         information in addition to the news itself.  Put the news \r\n         release on your BBS stationary and include a business card.  \r\n         Even if your News Release is thrown away, the business card \r\n         might be put int'b"o someone's rolodex.\r\n\r\n              Focus on your information.  What exactly is it you want \r\n         to convey?  The best news releases usually have one specific \r\n         point to make and everything else supports that one point.  \r\n         Think logically.  Your first paragraph, or the lead to use \r\n         journalistic jargon, should make your point clear.  The \r\n         second paragraph should have more information that supports \r\n         the first, the third should support the second and first"b', so \r\n         on and so on.  \r\n\r\n              Write simply.  Don\'t use "big" words unless you \r\n         absolutely have to.  They won\'t impress anyone.  You should \r\n         also write short simple sentences.  Long complex sentences \r\n         are harder to read.  Newspapers are written at an eighth \r\n         grade reading level.  Broadcasters have only one chance to \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         make the listener/viewe'b'r understand the story.  If you have \r\n         the media confused you will be ignored.\r\n\r\n              Avoid the use of computer, modem or telecommunications \r\n         jargon.  Jargon that is used should be explained in simple \r\n         terms.  For instance: "GIFs are pictures that can be viewed \r\n         on a computer screen."  That may be oversimplified, but it \r\n         works.\r\n\r\n              One page is usually sufficient for a News Release.  Two \r\n         pages are acceptable, but more than tha'b't is pushing the \r\n         patience of the person you sent it to.  However, if you have \r\n         material to support your News Release, such as a graph or a \r\n         table, include that also.  If they want more information they \r\n         will call you.\r\n\r\n              Even if your News Release does not become recycling \r\n         fodder, it may not be used immediately.  It may be put into a \r\n         file for future use.  \r\n\r\n              The file PR-SAMP.TXT includes sample news releases along \r\n 'b'        with explanations of how and why they were written.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Public Service Announcements\r\n\r\n              Radio and TV stations devote some programming time to \r\n         Public Service Announcements, or P.S.A.s.  Newspapers may not \r\n         call them that, but they run them as well.  These are a bit \r\n         trickier to write than a News Release mainly because there \r\n         are fairly strict rules concerning what is or is not a PSA.\r\n\r\n         The litmus tests for a PS'b'A are:\r\n\r\n         1.  Is the group mentioned a profit organization?\r\n\r\n         2.  Is the topic of the PSA controversial?\r\n\r\n         3.  Is the group mentioned controversial?\r\n\r\n         4.  Will the reader/listener/viewer feel they are hearing an \r\n         ad as opposed to a PSA?\r\n\r\n              If the answer to any of those is "yes" that doesn\'t \r\n         necessarily mean it is not a PSA.  Chances are, though, it \r\n         won\'t qualify.\r\n\r\n              PSAs have much in common with News Releases 'b'in that they \r\n         will include Who, What, When, and Where, but might not have a \r\n         Why.  If there is a cost involved, that needs to be included \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         as well.\r\n\r\n              PSAs will normally be sent to the PSA Director at Radio \r\n         and TV stations.  PSAs sent to Newspapers can usually be sent \r\n         to the Editor, who will know which department to send it to.\r\n\r\n           'b"   Many PSAs can be sent on a postcard.  The file PR- \r\n         SAMP.TXT has a sample PSA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               News Conferences\r\n\r\n              My first thought on holding a News Conference is not to \r\n         hold one.  Unless you have something of extreme importance or \r\n         of a compelling nature, a News Conference probably won't be \r\n         necessary.\r\n\r\n              There are only two reasons I can think of for a BBS to \r\n         hold a News Conference.  One is when a BBS is"b' launched, but \r\n         even that is of marginal news value. The other is Crisis \r\n         Management.\r\n\r\n              Whichever the case may be, you need to be fully \r\n         prepared.  Have copies of your statement and support \r\n         materials available to distribute to members of the media \r\n         that attend.\r\n\r\n              If I am hesitant to recommend a News Conference, I am \r\n         adamantly against a Sysop holding a question and answer \r\n         session only.  If you have a News C'b'onference, you had better \r\n         have something specific to say or you are going to alienate \r\n         those attending.  \r\n\r\n              Although it is acceptable to read directly from your \r\n         printed statement during your News Conference, you need to \r\n         practice it several times beforehand so you are completely \r\n         familiar with it.  You might even want to practice the entire \r\n         News Conference.  This can be accomplished by having some \r\n         friends or business as'b'sociates listen to your statement and \r\n         grill you afterword.  Chances are many of the same questions \r\n         a reporter will ask will be asked by this "practice group."\r\n\r\n              Why do you need to answer questions following your \r\n         statement?  There may be something in your statement that was \r\n         unclear, or maybe needed to be expanded.  Sometimes you might \r\n         even be asked to repeat certain sections.  But when things \r\n         appear to be slowing down, don\'t be 'b"afraid to call an end to \r\n         the News Conference.  Make yourself available for individual \r\n         interviews following the News Conference.  TV or radio \r\n         stations might want a more intimate sounding discussion of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 13\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         what the News Conference was about instead of the formal \r\n         statement.  A reporter might have a question he/she didn't \r\n         want to ask in a group setti"b"ng.\r\n\r\n              Your News Conference will be competing with all the \r\n         other news events going on throughout the day.  Don't waste \r\n         time and don't expect everyone invited to attend.  I've found \r\n         early afternoon or mid morning to be the best times to hold \r\n         News Conferences.\r\n\r\n              News Conferences can be a very productive method of \r\n         getting your message across.  But they are also quite \r\n         misused.  Hold a News Conference only if you feel "b'the need is \r\n         absolutely imperative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                             \xb3Handling the Media?\n                             \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n              Timeliness is a very important factor when sending \r\n         material to the media.  \r\n\r\n              Most News Releases that are not dated can be mailed at \r\n         any time.  If they are going to be for release on a specific \r\n         date, they should be mailed one to two weeks be'b'fore the date.  \r\n         Public Service Announcements and Event Schedules should be \r\n         sent two to four weeks before the event.\r\n\r\n              This gives the media plenty of time to schedule \r\n         reporters and other resources.\r\n\r\n              I do not recommend calling an Editor or reporter asking \r\n         when your News Release or PSA will be published or aired.  \r\n         They might consider this badgering.  However, you might call \r\n         and ask if they received it and had any q'b"uestions.  That \r\n         doesn't guarantee that it will be used, but it might increase \r\n         its chances, and you might even find out when it would be \r\n         used.\r\n\r\n              The Media is not the enemy.  When you are talking with a \r\n         reporter or a group of reporters there is no need to be \r\n         nervous.  Be friendly but professional.  Treat them as you \r\n         would your co-workers.\r\n\r\n              Generally, be calm but assertive.  You have the \r\n         information they"b' want.  Because computer communications is \r\n         still a burgeoning field, reporters may ask what you think \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 14\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         are dumb or inconsequential questions.  Just answer them \r\n         patiently.  Offer information you think is pertinent to the \r\n         issue.  The more facts they have the more accurate the story \r\n         will be.\r\n\r\n              If you read, see or hear a news story that you fe'b"el was \r\n         unfair in its coverage of the BBS Community, don't be afraid \r\n         to call or write the Editor or News Director and complain \r\n         about it.  Don't be angry, but point out what you feel was \r\n         unfair.  The worst thing you can do is get into an argument \r\n         with a member of the media.  Any headway you've made \r\n         previously can be destroyed.  You are more likely to be \r\n         listened to by being candid but keeping your head on your \r\n         shoulders.  "b"They might make a retraction to the offending \r\n         story or offer you the opportunity to set the record \r\n         straight.  If nothing else, you got it off your chest.\r\n\r\n              Video cameras are so ubiquitous these days that you \r\n         shouldn't give them a second thought.  You should be aware of \r\n         their presence though.  A dark sport jacket with a light \r\n         colored shirt works best on camera.  Flashy or very colorful \r\n         clothes can be very distracting.  The viewe"b"r might pay more \r\n         attention to what you are wearing than what you are saying.\r\n\r\n              Never, ever, at any time knowingly tell a falsehood.  \r\n         You'll be caught and you'll be hung out to dry.  If you say \r\n         something that later turns out to be incorrect, then you can \r\n         honestly admit your mistake.  In addition, if there is \r\n         something you don't know, admit that also.  It's always \r\n         better to admit a lack of knowledge than it is to dance \r\n        "b' around a question with a pseudo-answer.  You can always look \r\n         up the correct answer and call the reporter later.\r\n\r\n              Drawing on that same theme, if you have gotten into a \r\n         situation in which you feel you have gotten in over your \r\n         head, defer the issue to someone you feel comfortable has the \r\n         proper skills and knowledge.  In most cases, a reporter will \r\n         accept your suggested replacement.  The only time it might \r\n         not work is when the re'b'porter is asking about something that \r\n         directly impacts you or your BBS.  \r\n\r\n              This may seem obvious, but you should return calls \r\n         promptly.  Reporters are always under some sort of deadline \r\n         pressure.  The sooner you can return their calls, the more \r\n         they will appreciate you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 15\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                   'b"            \xb3Market Research?\n                               \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n              Who needs to do Market Research?  You do.  The days of \r\n         opening up a BBS with a few file areas and some message bases \r\n         are numbered.  Successful BBSs will be those that plan \r\n         carefully with an eye toward what users really want-- not the \r\n         desires of the noisy few.\r\n\r\n              While online questionnaires are quite useful, they often \r\n         don't go far enough or have "b"a large enough base for you to \r\n         make long term decisions.  The biggest problems are low \r\n         response rates and questions that answer themselves.  Very few \r\n         online surveys that I've seen provide enough qualitative \r\n         information for anything other than short term planning.\r\n\r\n              If you are planning on pulling in some new message \r\n         bases, but want to know which ones will actually be read by \r\n         users, then online questionnaires are quite sufficient"b' for the \r\n         job.  But if you plan on opening a new BBS, a major change in \r\n         image or thrust, or becoming a larger player in the BBS \r\n         community you probably need to do more than question your \r\n         active users.\r\n\r\n              But there are still times in which you must simply go \r\n         with your visceral instincts.  If you have just done the most \r\n         extensive survey in the history of the industry, you may just \r\n         have to do what your gut tells you to do,'b" even if it is in \r\n         total disagreement with what the research says you should do.\r\n\r\n              The easiest, least expensive, and probably the most \r\n         effective research for BBSs to do is call-out research.  Pick \r\n         up the phone and start dialing.  But you must have a method.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Creating a Survey\r\n\r\n              Depending on what you want to find out, you'll want to \r\n         angle your research in different directions.  A person \r\n         sett"b"ing up a new BBS is going to need information different \r\n         from that an established Sysop would need to consider whether \r\n         to expand or add services.\r\n\r\n              For our purposes, let's assume you want to do some basic \r\n         research on the group of people that use modems.  To make \r\n         things as easy as possible, we'll assume you will be \r\n         conducting 100 surveys.  This does NOT include people who \r\n         hang up on you or you terminate because they do not fit th"b"e \r\n         demographic profile you are looking for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 16\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              The first thing you'll need to determine is the \r\n         demographic breakdown in your community as a whole.  What is \r\n         the percentage of men and women and their age groups?  This \r\n         information can easily be found at your local library.  Use \r\n         the most recent census data available.  Take those \r\n         percen"b"tages in each age/sex demo and conduct the same number \r\n         of surveys (23% women aged 25 to 32 in your community, then \r\n         23 surveys with women in that age group).\r\n\r\n              The first thing you need in the survey is a set of \r\n         Terminal questions.  These questions help you determine the \r\n         age and sex groups you need, whether they own computers, \r\n         whether they own modems and how often they use modems.  If \r\n         they don't answer any of the questions in the"b' appropriate \r\n         manner, you break off the interview.  These people are NOT \r\n         included as part of your 100 completed surveys.\r\n\r\n              If you want an overview of the BBS community compared to \r\n         the community as a whole, you will need to keep track of the \r\n         people that are terminated.\r\n\r\n              Since we are developing a profile on the modem using \r\n         public in your community, we need a set of questions to \r\n         determine how often they use them and'b' in what manner.  We \r\n         then need some questions to find out what services they use, \r\n         what activities they participate in, and what they might see \r\n         as any shortcomings. \r\n\r\n         Finally, some questions on their hardware and software.\r\n\r\n              All these numbers can be inserted into a spreadsheet \r\n         program.  From there you can make pie charts or bar graphs to \r\n         represent just about anything and help you make planning \r\n         decisions.\r\n\r\n         T'b'here is a sample survey in the BBS-SAMP.TXT file.\r\n\r\n              Here are some terms that are in the sample survey that \r\n         you might want to know:\r\n\r\n              PROMPT-- Ask about listed items.  Subject may offer one \r\n         or more.\r\n              QUERY-- Ask for more, do NOT specify.  Ask "Anything \r\n         else?" and write down responses\r\n              (see XX)-- Depending on response to a question, then go \r\n         to the question with that number (eg: see 5B)\r\n              SPECIFY-'b"- Subject may offer an answer.  If not, ask.\r\n              TERMINATE-- Bring to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Making the Call\r\n\r\n              You don't need to buy a list in order to make call out \r\n         research.  All it takes is a phone book or city directory.  \r\n         City directories are helpful in that they will have phone \r\n         numbers and addresses that may not be in the "b'phone book.  \r\n         City directories are also expensive, especially when compared \r\n         to that phone book you received when you ordered a phone \r\n         line.\r\n\r\n              Starting with the first residential listing, keep \r\n         dialing down the column until you are able to get a completed \r\n         survey.  Skip the rest of that column, next column and start \r\n         at the top of the following.\r\n\r\n              For example, if you have a three column phone book (most \r\n         are)'b', you get a completed survey on the tenth call in the \r\n         second column.  Skip the remainder of the second column, skip \r\n         the third column, and then start again at the top of the \r\n         first column on the second page.  This will give you a fairly \r\n         random sample.\r\n\r\n              Also make sure you do not purposely call business \r\n         numbers.  Businesses get irritated when people make \r\n         unsolicited calls.  Many individuals do as well.  Expect a \r\n         lot of 'b'people to hang up on you.\r\n\r\n              ALWAYS thank the person at the end of the interview, \r\n         even if you terminate them after the first question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                              \xb3Crisis Management?\n                              \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n              The first thing to remember about Crisis Management is \r\n         to avoid creating one.  That isn\'t always possible.  In that \r\n         case, the second thing to remember is "Do'b'n\'t Panic."  You \r\n         simply don\'t have time.  Always keep your head.\r\n\r\n              It\'s quite unlikely BBSs will be responsible for \r\n         volcanic eruptions or toxic waste dumps.  Most crisis a BBS \r\n         would be involved in are legal in nature.  If that\'s the \r\n         case, you\'ll need to contact your attorney at once.\r\n\r\n              In fact, you might even want to consider keeping one on \r\n         retainer or having a pre-paid legal plan.  Your attorney \r\n         should be famili'b'ar with communications law and First \r\n         Amendment Issues.  Your local Bar Association should be able \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 18\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         to help you find one.\r\n\r\n              The media has easier access to prosecutors than to \r\n         defendants.  That is why in most criminal cases it appears a \r\n         suspect has already been convicted and hauled off even though \r\n         the case has not yet been brought to trial. 'b" The good news is \r\n         that more defense attorneys are becoming media savvy and are \r\n         willing to make statements to reporters.\r\n\r\n              Most of the time, the best thing to do is to let your \r\n         attorney do your talking for you.  Among other things, that's \r\n         what you are paying him for.  He will know what can and \r\n         cannot be said in public and is in a better position to deal \r\n         with legal intricacies that may come up.\r\n\r\n              For now, the onlin"b'e community tends to rally around BBS \r\n         operators who have been accused of improprieties.  Unless \r\n         your counselor objects, you can begin drumming up support \r\n         from within the industry.  Among other things, you can make \r\n         legal documents available in computer readable form.  Contact \r\n         industry magazines such as BOARDWATCH, BBS CALLERS DIGEST and \r\n         CONNECT and let them know what is happening.  But you should \r\n         always advise or consult your attorn'b"ey before doing any of \r\n         this.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Friendly Faces\r\n\r\n              I've made this point before and I'll make it again.  \r\n         Reporters assigned to cover a story involving BBSs or other \r\n         online services may not fully understand the industry.  Some \r\n         of them may even be technophobes.\r\n\r\n              With that in mind, there is another position you can \r\n         work yourself into.  That is the position of the Local \r\n         Expert.  For sa"b'ke of example, another Sysop has run into \r\n         trouble with the law.  You could make yourself available to \r\n         help explain what some of those complicated technological \r\n         terms are all about, making sure you stay clear of the legal \r\n         issues involved.  You may not get your face on TV or your \r\n         name printed in the paper, but you will be providing a \r\n         valuable service to your local media.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              The First Amendment\r\n                  'b"                  at Risk\r\n\r\n              The online community is under attack.  There are many \r\n         in government who apparently believe First Amendment freedoms \r\n         should not be extended to BBSs and other online services, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 19\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         even if they don't explicitly state this.  The Clipper chip \r\n         is just one example.\r\n\r\n              The battle lines are being drawn in the courts and "b'in \r\n         the mainstream media.  Solid wins in the justice system will \r\n         help ensure a place for the First Amendment in the future.  \r\n         Diligent and deft manipulation of the media will help ensure \r\n         public support for the online community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                               \xb3Out of the Box?\n                               \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n              Many Sysops set up a BBS in a cloistered room, hunch \r\n         over a br'b'ightly lit screen late at night tweaking here and \r\n         tweaking there.  "Heh!" they think, "this new door game will \r\n         bring me a few more callers!"\r\n\r\n              Wrong.\r\n\r\n              You can be assured that new game is A) already on \r\n         another BBS in town, B) the potential new callers won\'t know \r\n         for sometime that you have it or C) potential new callers \r\n         won\'t care that you have it.\r\n\r\n              The game can wait \'til tomorrow.  Do something that is \r\n   'b"      more likely to bring in potential callers to your BBS in \r\n         particular and into the BBS community generally.  Get out of \r\n         the house.\r\n\r\n              Chances are your BBS or the local BBS or Sysops' \r\n         Association sponsors a picnic or some such at least once a \r\n         year.  Although this is a good idea, it usually is a \r\n         gathering a modem users.  You need to become more involved \r\n         with the community as a whole.\r\n\r\n              There are many, many oppor"b'tunities to create a good \r\n         public relations image within the community.  Even though the \r\n         mainstream media should be a part of your public relations \r\n         efforts, you do not have to rely on them to tell your \r\n         message.\r\n\r\n              Your local Chamber of Commerce probably has some sort of \r\n         monthly or annual list of events going on in the community.  \r\n         There should be several that you can attend or co-sponsor on \r\n         behalf of the BBS.  You can a'b"lso make yourself available to \r\n         talk to Service Clubs and Youth Groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Have you thought of conducting a seminar?  Let's face \r\n         it, BBSs are not among the easiest computer applications to \r\n         use.  You could teach users and potential users about \r\n         telecommunications and BBSing.  With more and more BBSs \r\n         connecting to the Internet, a seminar on ho"b'w to use the \r\n         Internet could be quite valuable.  As an aside, you might \r\n         even be able to bring in a few bucks by conducting seminars.\r\n\r\n              Schools are another place to make your mark.  Donate \r\n         your time to teach a class or be a guest in a class.  You \r\n         might even consider donating your old equipment to an \r\n         elementary school when you upgrade to newer equipment.  That \r\n         might even bring you some good press coverage.\r\n\r\n              If you 'b"have a laptop or an older computer you wouldn't \r\n         mind toting around, take it with you with a scaled down \r\n         version of your BBS to show people what it looks like.  Very \r\n         few things work better than a good visual aid.  \r\n\r\n              If you produce a newsletter for your BBS that is mailed \r\n         to users on a regular basis, add the local media outlets to \r\n         your mailing list.  Just as with News Releases, most \r\n         newsletters will be thrown out.  But sometimes"b" someone will \r\n         grab an idea from one and produce a story from it.  By golly, \r\n         you'll probably be the first person they call.\r\n\r\n              Everyday thousands of cars go past yours or you pass \r\n         them.  Bumper stickers are moving billboards.  Make them \r\n         available anytime you are out meeting the public.  Because \r\n         you must make a quick impression, just have the name of your \r\n         BBS and the data phone number printed on them.\r\n\r\n              Coffee mugs "b'and t-shirts are good promotional items that \r\n         can also bring in some money.  Sale items such as those are \r\n         really best for larger commercial systems, though.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                               \xb3Final Comments?\n                               \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n              I am quite conscience of the fact that I did not discuss \r\n         paid advertising in this manual.

The \r\n         charge for the seminar was included since it was necessary, \r\n         but it was buried deep in the news relea'b"se.\r\n\r\n              If you'll notice, both of these news releases have a \r\n         contact name and number.

Whether you \r\n         have a 32 line commercial BBS, a single line hobby board or \r\n         somewhere in between, you are selling a service.  Just as \r\n         with any 'b'other product, you have to decide where and how your \r\n         public relations efforts should best be spent.  \r\n\r\n              Now may be a good time to look at your BBS and take an \r\n         inventory.  The Inventory included at the beginning of this \r\n         file will help you take stock of the strengths and weaknesses \r\n         of your BBS.  Some of these things you may already have \r\n         thought of.  Others possibly not.  Whatever the case may be, \r\n         this is a very subjective matter 'b'and there are no right or \r\n         wrong answers.\r\n\r\n              We\'ll take this step by step and briefly examine some of \r\n         the immediate public relations problems your BBS may present \r\n         and some ways to solve those problems.\r\n\r\n              I want you to bear in mind that it is NOT my intention \r\n         to tell you how to run your BBS.  In addition, I don\'t think \r\n         there are any "bad" features for a BBS, except of course \r\n         those that are patently illegal.  If anyt'b'hing like that is \r\n         implied, it wasn\'t intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n         BBS NAME:\r\n\r\n              The name of your BBS should be chosen very carefully and \r\n         it should be in keeping with the overall tone of the BBS.  \r\n         Chances are you wouldn\'t want to call your BBS "Thunder of \r\n         Cloven Hooves" if the emphasis is on scholarly Biblical \r\n         discussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Sysop:\r\n\r\n              If you are known to users mainly as the Sysop, that \r\n         could be creating an alo'b"of image.  That could be the image \r\n         you want.  On some larger boards with staffs that may be the \r\n         best way to handle administrative duties.  But if you want to \r\n         have a more folksy and personable board you need to make \r\n         yourself known.  Create an account with your name, if you \r\n         haven't already done so.  Encourage users to refer to you \r\n         with your name, instead of The Sysop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    YOUR PRODU"b'CT pg 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    General Interest/Special Focus\r\n\r\n              You may want to have a BBS with a little bit of \r\n         everything for everybody.  Even with cable becoming more \r\n         prevalent, the three major broadcast networks still have the \r\n         largest viewership.  A General Interest BBS with a very large \r\n         plate to offer will draw users but could overwhelm some \r\n         users, especially new users.  \r\n\r\n              A BBS with a specific intere'b"st runs the risk of being \r\n         too narrowly defined.  There is probably a market for a BBS \r\n         about horse racing jockeys six feet and taller with green \r\n         eyes, but it's also so specialized it would attract few \r\n         callers (if any).\r\n\r\n\r\n         Users\r\n\r\n              Most BBS have very large user lists.  Many of those \r\n         lists are bogus in that they reflect all the people that have \r\n         visited since the BBS was established.  Some Sysops routinely \r\n         clea"b"n the chaff out of the user lists.  This is a good idea \r\n         in that it makes it easier for Sysops to keep track of who is \r\n         active and who is not.  In addition it helps users who log in \r\n         only occasionally.  If a user hasn't logged on recently he \r\n         has usually lost track of what happened the last time he was \r\n         on.  It reminds occasional users that it might be a good idea \r\n         to stop in more often.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Money:\r\n\r\n              As I'm sure you are awa"b're, a Bulletin Board can cost a \r\n         lot to operate.  The trend is to charge some kind of \r\n         subscription.  There are a number of different ways in which \r\n         to do this.  A very large portion of the BBS community \r\n         believes that charging for access violates the spirit of \r\n         freedom of information that has been intertwined with \r\n         personal computers since their introduction.  You will face \r\n         that sort of resistance, especially if your BBS has had a \r\n   'b'      history of access at no charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n         FILES:\r\n\r\n              File areas are arguably the heart of a BBS.  And just as \r\n         with a human heart, they can create a huge amount of trouble \r\n         if not properly taken care of.    \r\n\r\n              File Requests can be a valuable promotional tool.  Many \r\n         software companies allow potential buyers to request a demo \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     YOUR PRODUCT pg 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         from t'b"heir support board to try the software before \r\n         purchasing it.  Some BBSs allow downloads of certain \r\n         informational files without having the caller registered or \r\n         verified.  This is potentially a very powerful feature and \r\n         probably should be implemented on your BBS if it isn't \r\n         already.  A file explaining your policies, the message bases \r\n         available, some hints on how to use your BBS (especially if \r\n         it uses a less well known software packag"b"e), and maybe even a \r\n         registration or subscription form.  This gives the user an \r\n         idea of what your BBS is like and can leave him with a good \r\n         feeling in that he received something without having full \r\n         access.\r\n\r\n              BBSs are commonly cited as a major source of computer \r\n         viruses.  If you take great pains to check all files for \r\n         viruses before making them publicly available then you can \r\n         put many users' minds at ease.  Make sure "b'you promote that \r\n         often on your BBS and in any advertising you do.  Sometimes a \r\n         virus will sneak through even the best virus checkers.  Track \r\n         down the offending file, delete it and apologize to those who \r\n         downloaded it.  But gently remind users that you are not \r\n         responsible for damage caused by the virus.  They downloaded \r\n         and used it at their own risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Message Bases:\r\n\r\n              If File Areas are the heart of a BBS, then the M'b'essage \r\n         Bases are the soul of your BBS.  That is where your users \r\n         have the biggest opportunity to contribute to the board.  \r\n         This is also where you have the biggest opportunity to set \r\n         the image of the BBS.  Your message bases can be wide and \r\n         varied or narrow and focused on just a few topics.  Keep in \r\n         mind not everyone is going to be tactful and considerate.  \r\n         Some are rude and downright mean.\r\n\r\n              Nationally echoed message'b" bases can be a valuable asset \r\n         to your board.  But there will be times when there are \r\n         matters of interest in Waxahachie, Texas that folks in Erie, \r\n         Pennsylvania won't be interested in.  Chances are you have at \r\n         least one message base that is specific for local matters.  \r\n         You may want to consider opening up a few others depending on \r\n         the demand from your users.     \r\n\r\n\r\n         DOORS:\r\n\r\n              Your choice of Door programs create a twofol"b"d public \r\n         relations challenge right out of the box.  First, there may \r\n         be times in which you add a door that doesn't quite fit the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     YOUR PRODUCT pg 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         image you are trying to create on your BBS.  In that case \r\n         it's a fairly simple matter to remove the door program.  \r\n         Second, a very popular door could tie up your BBS for hours a \r\n         day with just a few users, causing fru"b'stration to others.  \r\n         This is particularly true of games.  \r\n\r\n\r\n         MISC:\r\n\r\n              Most BBSs run a screen full of Bulletins when the user \r\n         logs on.  These bulletins should be updated as often as \r\n         possible.  Callers need to know what\'s going on with your \r\n         BBS, even if it\'s just the latest scores for "Red Dragon."  \r\n         Most users don\'t read the bulletins on a regular basis.  But, \r\n         they leave the impression that you have a "happening" BBS. 'b' A \r\n         business owner I once worked for said to me "The impression \r\n         that we have business generates business."  He always made \r\n         sure there were cars in front of his business, even if they \r\n         belonged to employees.  Your bulletins can be the cars in \r\n         front of your business.  \r\n\r\n              Curiously, though, a lot of bulletins can also turn away \r\n         a user.  If you have a potload of bulletins, you might want \r\n         to think about moving some to areas'b' in which they are more \r\n         appropriate.  Bulletins of game scores might be moved to a \r\n         gaming conference, as an example.  Rules, policies and news \r\n         should be the primary considerations when developing log on \r\n         bulletins.  \r\n\r\n              There are several BBS and Sysop groups and associations \r\n         that you can become a member of.  There might even be one or \r\n         more in your area.  They are sources of support, solutions, \r\n         and other information.  I'b'f you are having trouble with \r\n         another sysop, the association can be a place to arbitrate \r\n         your difficulties.  If worse comes to worse and you run afoul \r\n         of the law as a result of your BBS, the group may be able to \r\n         put you in touch with some legal help.\r\n\r\n              A meeting can also provide you with the opportunity to \r\n         unwind after a hard day of slaving over a hot keyboard.  I \r\n         strongly recommend joining a group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r'b"\n                                                     YOUR PRODUCT pg 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                                \xb3GOAL SETTING?\n                                \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n              Even if you don't run a commercial BBS, you should think \r\n         of it as a business.  There is hardly any business that does \r\n         not take an inventory on a regular basis.   Any business that \r\n         does not analyze itself occasionally is doome"b"d to failure.\r\n\r\n              Every six months or so, sit back and look at where your \r\n         BBS has been, where it's at and where it's going.  Do you \r\n         have specific goals in mind?  What are you doing to meet \r\n         those goals?  How is your Public Relations campaign \r\n         reflecting the climb toward those goals?\r\n\r\n              Whatever you are up to, PROMOTE, PROMOTE, PROMOTE.  Tell \r\n         your users what's going on.  Tell your co-workers.  Tell the \r\n         dog.  Get the wo"b'rd out on the street somehow.  \r\n\r\n              This is only a cursory look at some the things you \r\n         should be aware of from a public relations standpoint as you \r\n         examine your BBS.  You might want to do things differently.  \r\n         Public relations is an art, and you may prefer to do yours in \r\n         oil while I prefer chalk.\r\n\r\n              I encourage you to write me and let me know what your \r\n         are doing in the area of Public Relations.\r\n\r\n         Robert Parson\r\n      'b'   2501 Phoenix\r\n         Fort Smith, AR 72901\r\n         501 646 9332 (voice)\r\n         Paradox of Arkansas BBS 501 484 0944/501 484 1043\r\n         (Fred Ayers, Sysop)\r\n         Jackalope Junction BBS 501 785 5381 (Steve Prado, Sysop)\r\n         internet   r.parson@genie.geis.com\r\n         GEnie      R.Parson\r\n         Fido       1:3822/1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     YOUR PRODUCT pg 5\r\n\r\n\r\n::::::::::::::\npr-rates.txt\n::::::::::::::\n                    'b'        \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                            \xb3BBS Public Relations?\n                            ?Aphelion Promotions?\n                            \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n                                 Robert Parson\r\n                                 2501 Phoenix\r\n                             Fort Smith, AR 72901\r\n                             501 646 9332 (voice)\r\n\r\n                                  Support BBS\r\n                    Paradox of Arkansas (Fred Ayers, Sysop)\r\n                  'b'         501 484 0944/501 484 1043\r\n                    Jackalope Junction (Steve Prado, Sysop)\r\n                                 501 785 5381\r\n\r\n                       Internet r.parson@genie.geis.com\r\n                                 Fido 1:3822/1\r\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                                ?

I have tried to jam as \r\n         much solid information about Public Relations into as small a \r\n         package as possible.  \r\n\r\n              There is no intent to tell Sysops how a BBS should be \r\n         run.  If that is implied at any point, I apologize in \r\n         advance.  \r\n\r\n              All files in this guide are (c) 1993 and 1994 Rob'b'ert \r\n         Parson.

First, that image was tarnished by \r\n         stories of pirated software, then by stories of viruses and \r\n         most recently the rash of stories involving pedophiles using \r\n         BBSs to further their illegal activity (child pornography).\r\n\r\n              This guide is not intended to be the final word on \r\n         pu'b"blic relations for BBSs.  Someone is always coming up with \r\n         a new idea or putting a new spin on an old one.  This is just \r\n         a basic guide with some general rules of thumb you can use to \r\n         enhance the image of your BBS.

That in itself is the single biggest \r\n         Public Relations problem a Sysop faces.  BBS users, \r\n         obviously, fall somewhere in the remaining 45 percent.  \r\n\r\n              Those who fear technology are the ones that are the most \r\n         difficult to explain electronic communications to.  The'b'y may \r\n         see computers as taking over their lives.  There are chips in \r\n         their cars, in their microwaves, in their stereos, and in \r\n         their VCRS.  Computers send them their utility bills, credit \r\n         card bills, track their income tax payments, and note when \r\n         their daughter is born.\r\n\r\n              Those in that 55 percent are not necessarily \r\n         technophobic.  Most of them are just technologically \r\n         disinterested.  These are the people that we shoul'b"d be most \r\n         concerned with from a Public Relations standpoint.  What they \r\n         know about computers, modems and BBSs comes from the \r\n         mainstream media.  A reporter assigned to a story about BBSs \r\n         may or may not fully understand what they are reporting on.\r\n\r\n              The remaining 45 percent includes you and me, the expert \r\n         user, the average user and the novice user.  This group \r\n         doesn't need quite as much public relations massaging since \r\n        "b' it already knows the benefits of using a modem to connect \r\n         with other people.\r\n\r\n              People that were overwhelmed when they first called a \r\n         BBS and decided it was too tough to try again also fall into \r\n         that 45 percent.  They have computers, they may be \r\n         technically adept, they can probably even program a VCR.  But \r\n         the mysteries of 8-N-1 elude them.  In addition, there are \r\n         those who were at one time active in the BBS community, but \r\n  'b"       are no longer involved.  Maybe they had a falling out with a \r\n         Sysop or another user.  These are both disaffected users\r\n\r\n              There is also the group of people that have modems \r\n         because it came with their computer but they have not used \r\n         it.   Some because they don't know they have one, some \r\n         because they aren't interested in using it.\r\n\r\n              How can you distill all these diverse groups into one \r\n         simple Public Relations campaign?  "b"Simply put, you can't.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   The Media\r\n\r\n              News can be defined broadly as something that is out of \r\n         the ordinary (such as a murder) or something that is a matter \r\n         of public record (such as a City Council meeting).  \r\n         Generally, though, news is a change in the status quo.\r\n\r\n              Many people get upset over what is perceived as"b' a \r\n         liberal or conservative slant in the news.  Because both \r\n         sides get upset about slanted news, that indicates to me that \r\n         most media coverage is unbiased or at least politically \r\n         moderate.  So-called objective reporting is a relatively \r\n         recent invention.  Before the American Civil War, most \r\n         newspapers were just a cut above political tracts.  But \r\n         journalism history and theory is not our topic.\r\n\r\n              Most stories involving B'b"BSs involve a crime that has \r\n         been committed, usually pirated software, viruses, or \r\n         pornography.  Even though one BBS may be raided for \r\n         improprieties, it reflects poorly on the entire BBS community \r\n         by guilt through association.  This is similar to many \r\n         American's mistrust of all Arabs due to the misdeeds of a \r\n         few, as an example.  It isn't fair, it isn't right, but it's \r\n         The Way Things Are.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4"b'\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                              \xb3Finding the Media?\n                              \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n              The easiest way to find out who you need to talk to or \r\n         write to is by looking in the phone book.  All the TV and \r\n         Radio stations and Newspapers will be listed under those \r\n         categories.  You might want to also look for Magazines and \r\n         News Services.\r\n\r\n              A phone call can uncover a lot of information.  You will \r\n         need the med'b"ia outlet's voice number, fax number, address and \r\n         the person to talk to or send mailings to.\r\n\r\n              Your best luck in the Public Relations arena is going to \r\n         be in the local media.  Remember that not all your public \r\n         relations efforts are going to be successful.  For instance, \r\n         most News Releases are thrown in the trash.  But if you keep \r\n         at it your efforts will pay off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          "b" BBS-PR pg 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Newspaper\r\n\r\n              Because of the rise of electronic information \r\n         distribution, many people have predicted the demise of \r\n         newspapers.  That's unlikely, at least for the next fifty to \r\n         one hundred years.  Yes, readership has declined.  \r\n         Newspapers, though, are chameleons and are able to adapt.  \r\n         Thirty years ago most newspapers looked like the New York \r\n         Times.  Most newspap"b'ers now have much more open and \r\n         "friendly" looks.  \r\n\r\n              They are also the most powerful of all the media.  No \r\n         other media shapes and forms public opinion to the degree \r\n         newspapers do.  This is usually because they have larger news \r\n         staffs and much longer traditions than broadcast media.  \r\n         Print also has a permanence that broadcast does not have.    \r\n\r\n              As a Sysop, your Public Relations efforts should start \r\n         with the Edi'b'tor or City Editor, whichever the case may be.  \r\n         These Editors will assign stories to a reporter.\r\n\r\n              You may be tempted to change your mailing list to a \r\n         certain reporter.  Although this may seem like a good idea, \r\n         reporters tend to change jobs on a fairly regular basis (this \r\n         is especially the case in broadcast media).  You might opt to \r\n         add a reporter to your list, but make sure you continue to \r\n         send material to the Editor.\r\n\r\n     'b'         I do not recommend offering to write a column.  You will \r\n         run out of things to write about much sooner than you think.  \r\n         Not only that, newspapers have access to syndicated columns \r\n         that may not deal specifically with BBSs, but will touch on \r\n         them occasionally.  \r\n\r\n              The opinion page provides several opportunities to get \r\n         your name and the name of your BBS out.  The Letters to the \r\n         Editor section can be quite effective in tell'b'ing your \r\n         message.  You might even be asked occasionally to write a \r\n         guest opinion.  Use those opportunities whenever possible, \r\n         but be wary of writing too many Letters to the Editor.  If \r\n         they get printed often, you will lose your impact and become \r\n         just another shrill voice on the opinion page.\r\n\r\n              News about computers and computer technology tends to \r\n         become lodged in the Business section of a newspaper.  If \r\n         your paper ha'b's one, you need to put the Business Editor on \r\n         your mailing list.\r\n\r\n             Be careful with multiple mailings to newspapers.  If you \r\n         have a News Conference, you could have several people from         \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         one newspaper there.  There are few things that annoy editors \r\n         more than finding out that the paper had "overstaffed" a news \r\n         conference.  It might be w'b'ise to note on the announcement the \r\n         departments or individuals that are getting copies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Television\r\n\r\n              Television thrives on good video.  Too often, a story \r\n         with good video will override a good story with no video.  \r\n         That is part of the reason why even though nearly everyone \r\n         watches tv news, hardly anyone trusts it.  Despite that, \r\n         television can get your message across to more people in a \r\n         sho'b'rter period of time.\r\n\r\n              Assignment Editors are the people that tell the \r\n         reporters what stories they will tell that day.  Most of your \r\n         productive work with tv stations will be with the Assignment \r\n         Editor.  Assignment Editors work with the Producer, and both \r\n         are supervised by the News Director.\r\n\r\n              Should you be lucky and they are interested in doing a \r\n         story about the current state of art in BBS technology, \r\n         remember th'b"at you need to make yourself visually compelling.  \r\n         Show lots of activity on the screen, blinking on the modem, \r\n         the tangle of wires for the phone lines.  \r\n\r\n              Present yourself as a business professional, even if you \r\n         are operating a one-line, non-commercial system.  That \r\n         doesn't necessarily mean you need to wear a suit and tie, \r\n         although that would be a good idea.\r\n\r\n              BBSs have become the whipping boy of tv news during the \r\n     "b'    past year.  Sex and Pornography are probably the topics they \r\n         will be most interested in, especially child pornography.  If \r\n         you are called out of the blue someday by a tv reporter \r\n         wishing to do an interview, those are the likely topics.  Be \r\n         prepared to dodge bullets.  \r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Radio\r\n\r\n              Radio Journalism is a dying art.  There was once a time \r\n         when no radio station would even think of not having a news \r\n 'b"        department.  Now many stations have only a morning newsperson \r\n         that rewrites the morning paper, and they might not have even \r\n         that.  It's very tragic.\r\n\r\n              But there are still a very good number of radio stations \r\n         with active news departments.  For the most part, you will \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         deal directly with the News Director.  Some larger stations \r\n         may a"b'lso have an Assignments Editor.\r\n\r\n              Radio stations will be looking for stories that can be \r\n         told very quickly and have good "sound."  Normally, a radio \r\n         reporter will simply be seeking an interview.  But there may \r\n         be an occasion in which a reporter is doing a special report \r\n         or a series.  BBSs don\'t really have much sound to record, \r\n         but there is some.  Modem tones, connection alarms, and ANSI \r\n         music are a few.\r\n\r\n              Becaus'b'e the pace of radio news departments is even \r\n         faster than tv, believe it or not, it won\'t be uncommon for a \r\n         radio reporter to call on the phone to get a comment on a \r\n         breaking story or even a follow-up on a story idea you may \r\n         have presented them with in some correspondence.\r\n\r\n              If you are contacted on a "slow" news day, you and your \r\n         BBS could be included in a number of radio newscasts.  Even \r\n         in music intensive formats, radio news t'b'ends to be listener \r\n         active-- that is listeners pay close attention to the news.\r\n\r\n              News/Talk stations are particularly good targets.  They \r\n         are nearly always looking for good people to interview on the \r\n         air.\r\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                                \xb3Your Product?\n                                \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n                                You are the BBS\r\n\r\n\r\n              First of all, you have to think of your BB'b"S as a \r\n         product.  Whether you have a 32 line commercial BBS, a single \r\n         line hobby board or somewhere in between, you are selling a \r\n         service.  Just as with any other product, you have to decide \r\n         where and how your public relations efforts should best be \r\n         spent.  Would you sell Lambroghinis in rural Oklahoma?  You \r\n         can try, but you probably wouldn't sell very many.  And what \r\n         happens when your Lambroghini has a major recall?  How would \r\n  "b"       you handle the Public Relations crisis?\r\n\r\n              Now may be a good time to look at your BBS and take an \r\n         inventory.  If you haven't already done so, print the file \r\n         PRODUCT.TXT included with this package.  It will help you \r\n         take stock of the strengths and weaknesses of your BBS.  \r\n\r\n              PRODUCT.TXT examines the inventory and looks at some of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        "b' the immediate public relations problems that could occur as a \r\n         direct result of the features of your BBS.  Since this file \r\n         goes into depth about particular items on your BBS that may \r\n         cause some Public Relations problems, we won\'t discuss it in \r\n         detail here, but we will touch on some of the same issues.\r\n\r\n              The first and foremost question you should ask yourself \r\n         is "Why should someone call my BBS?"  To answer that \r\n         question, let\'s c'b"reate two BBSs to use as examples:\r\n\r\n              Beta BBS has message bases, files and a couple games.  \r\n         Delta BBS has message bases, files and a couple games.  \r\n         Nothing really different here.  The Sysop of Beta BBS is an \r\n         active participant in his BBS in that he writes messages on a \r\n         regular basis.  The Delta BBS Sysop turns up on occasion and \r\n         makes an announcement.  Hmmm.  Looks like Beta has a slight \r\n         edge; the Sysop doesn't seem so unreacha"b'ble.  There is \r\n         nothing wrong with Delta BBS, but it seems so ordinary.  \r\n         There are hundreds of other BBSs using the same software in \r\n         the same manner and it appears the Sysop is an out of state \r\n         landlord.  \r\n\r\n              If there is only one weapon I can give you in your \r\n         Public Relations campaign that weapon would be yourself.  You \r\n         must allow your personality to become a part of the BBS.\r\n\r\n              In this manner BBSs are identical to T'b"V News.  They may \r\n         offer the same plate, but the plate is presented a little \r\n         differently.  You might like the person who does the weather \r\n         more than the other station's weatherblond.  That is why you \r\n         watch Eyewitness News instead of The Newscenter or whatever \r\n         the case may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Graphics\r\n\r\n\r\n              Sometimes a subtle change in the graphics scheme can \r\n         make a big difference in how a user perceives your"b' BBS.  If \r\n         you use a lot of bright,garish colors a caller may get the \r\n         impression that the BBS is loud and brash.  Look closely at \r\n         how TV stations use color.  They generally use two or three \r\n         colors to set the overall graphics image and everything else \r\n         is either based on those colors or is worked into them \r\n         somehow.       \r\n\r\n              You should also examine how your menus are laid out.  \r\n         Your first concern should be whether they m'b"ake sense.  A \r\n         caller shouldn't have to scratch his head trying to figure \r\n         out what he should do next, unless he really has no idea.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Secondly, is the picture busy?  A busy menu page takes \r\n         longer to draw and is harder to read.  If after the screen is \r\n         drawn and you find yourself distracted, chances are your \r\n         layout has too many elements.\r\n\r\n"b'              Graphics artists for print publications talk about what \r\n         is called "white space."  That is the amount of nothingness \r\n         that surrounds text and pictures.  The more there is the more \r\n         pleasing to the eye the page is.  There is nothing wrong with \r\n         using a background to support your menus, but it should be \r\n         unobtrusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Making Changes\r\n\r\n              Whenever you change or add something you need to think \r\n     'b'    to yourself "Is this something that my users need or want?"  \r\n         You also need to think of the image you want your BBS to \r\n         present.  If you have a Science Fiction themed BBS, that new \r\n         CD-ROM of Civil War statistics may not fit in very well.\r\n\r\n              I want to make the point, though, that you might prefer \r\n         to run a BBS that offers something of interest to everyone.  \r\n         But if you do have a thread that runs throughout the entire \r\n         system you n'b"eed to think twice before making a change or an \r\n         addition.  If it doesn't feel right to you then it probably \r\n         won't be kosher with your users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                             \xb3TOOLS OF THE TRADE?\n                             \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n              You have your computer(s), phone lines(s), software, \r\n         message bases, and file areas.  But do you have your \r\n         stationary and business cards?  Unless you a"b"re running a \r\n         commercial system, you probably don't (and many commercial \r\n         systems don't either).\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Business Cards and Stationary\r\n\r\n              From time to time you'll want to write a letter as the \r\n         Sysop of your BBS.  This letter may be to a user, your city \r\n         officials, your Congressman or even to local media outlets.  \r\n         Your letter will carry more weight if it is on stationary.  \r\n         Make sure it has the name of your BBS,"b" mailing address, voice \r\n         line and data line.  Your name and title are options since \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         you will be signing it anyway.\r\n\r\n              If you work as a salesperson, an engineer, or any other \r\n         service oriented business, you wouldn't think twice about \r\n         getting business cards.  They are an essential part of your \r\n         business armament.  You hand them to every new per"b"son you \r\n         meet during the course of your day.  You should do the same \r\n         for your BBS.  \r\n\r\n              Business cards are an effective way of getting the word \r\n         out about your BBS.  You don't need anything fancy.  Just the \r\n         name of your BBS, your name, your title, a mailing address, \r\n         your voice line and your data line.\r\n\r\n              As for your title, I would recommend System Operator.  \r\n         The average person on the street, including some who claim "b'to \r\n         be computer literate, may not understand what "Sysop" means.\r\n\r\n              If you have even the slightest reason to write someone \r\n         on BBS stationary, then you should do it.  Always carry some \r\n         BBS business cards with you and pass them out at every \r\n         opportunity.  Stationary and business cards are inexpensive \r\n         and extremely effective.\r\n\r\n              One word of caution, though.  If your BBS is not \r\n         affiliated with your professional career, y'b'ou need to make \r\n         sure you keep the two separated.  This can be a problem when \r\n         handing out business cards in particular.  You might be \r\n         tempted to give a client cards from both work and your BBS.  \r\n         Should you do this, the client must be made aware that they \r\n         are two completely separate entities.  Not only that, but \r\n         your boss might not be too keen on the idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Brochures and Fliers\r\n\r\n              Brochures are als'b"o good promotional items for BBSs.   \r\n         Although they are not as necessary as business cards and \r\n         stationary, they can be very good tools.  Brochures can be \r\n         left at computer stores, taken to conventions, or used to \r\n         send in response to advertising.\r\n\r\n              Good brochures don't necessarily have to be \r\n         professionally produced, printed on glossy stock paper and \r\n         using four colors.  You can produce an effective brochure \r\n         using a deskt"b"op publishing program at home.  \r\n\r\n              A brochure should hit on the main points you want to \r\n         make, have some graphics, and entice the reader into calling.  \r\n         A brochure is intended to introduce your product to potential \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           BBS-PR pg 8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         callers.  Don't feel you should fill up the entire brochure \r\n         with a lot of copy.  For one thing, if there's a lot to read, \r\n         most "b"of it won't get read unless it is extremely compelling.  \r\n         The majority of the time, though, simple will suffice.\r\n\r\n              When developing your brochure, you should design it by \r\n         cutting the page in thirds and deciding what needs to be on \r\n         which page.  Obviously, you want the name of the BBS, the \r\n         phone number and maybe a graphic on the front.  You get to \r\n         the nitty gritty of what is on your board inside.  The middle \r\n         section of the outside "b'should be left blank so you can put an \r\n         address on it.\r\n\r\n              A flier generally is one page, and follows roughly the \r\n         same guidelines as those for a brochure.  In general, though, \r\n         you layout for the entire page instead of in thirds.\r\n\r\n              I mentioned "white space" earlier, and I want to \r\n         emphasize that again, especially in regard to your printed \r\n         materials.  The more white space you have, the more pleasing \r\n         to the eye your lay'b"out is.  Of course, that doesn't mean have \r\n         a blank page with only one sentence on it.  You do need to \r\n         keep your pages from looking cluttered and busy.\r\n\r\n                                Do it yourself\r\n                                      or\r\n                                 hire someone\r\n\r\n              Personal computers have liberated us to do work \r\n         ourselves that we would previously have hired someone to do.  \r\n         That includes personal publishing.  There are a num"b'ber of \r\n         desktop publishing programs available at your friendly \r\n         neighborhood computer store.

For roughly b'     anyone."  Keep the layout clean and simple, especially on the \r\n         cards.  If you have a graphic that is used to help identify \r\n         your BBS you should use it.\r\n\r\n              Colored paper and spot color can be very effective.  But \r\n         you need to be very careful.  Your information can be hard to \r\n         read on dark paper.  Spot color is exactly that-- a small \r\n         touch of color to highlight something on the page.  But it \r\n         can be put in the wrong place.\r\n\r\n    'b'          A couple things to note about having your work done \r\n         professionally:  colored paper and spot color usually cost \r\n         extra.  The printshop will also likely charge you to have a \r\n         graphic scanned and placed on your stationary or business \r\n         cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n::::::::::::::\nbbs-pr2.txt\n::::::::::::::\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                                \xb3News Products?\n                                \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n                           'b'      News Releases\r\n\r\n              News Releases can be among the most effective tools you \r\n         use in your public relations efforts.  This may seem hard to \r\n         believe, but much of what we read, hear or see in the news is \r\n         prompted by a news release.  The News Media really does want \r\n         to know what is going on in the community and News Releases \r\n         provide valuable tip-offs for stories.\r\n\r\n              Among other things, News Releases can be used to make \r\n        'b' yourself "The Expert" in the field.  There is much attention \r\n         being paid in Washington D.C. to the National Data Highway.  \r\n         By making yourself the expert in computer communications, \r\n         local media might contact you for local reaction to a story \r\n         about the National Data Highway or other topics, including \r\n         computer pornography.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              On any given day'b", a news department can receive dozens \r\n         of News Releases.  If you send a News Release to a Newspaper, \r\n         or Radio or TV station, don't assume it will be used.  Lack \r\n         of a local angle, lack of timeliness, and obvious business \r\n         promotion are among the reasons most are thrown away.  The \r\n         biggest portion of those that are thrown out, though, are \r\n         News Releases that are poorly written.\r\n\r\n    \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4"b'\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n    ?

Those are also essential to a News Release.\r\n\r\n              You should also strive for clarity and brevity.  Even if \r\n         'b'you consider yourself a poor writer, if you include all of \r\n         these factors, your News Release will probably be at the very \r\n         least readable.\r\n\r\n              A News Release should have a Headline, a release date \r\n         (even if all it says is FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE), and contact \r\n         information in addition to the news itself.  Put the news \r\n         release on your BBS stationary and include a business card.  \r\n         Even if your News Release is thrown away, the business card'b" \r\n         might be put into someone's rolodex.\r\n\r\n              Focus on your information.  What exactly is it you want \r\n         to convey?  The best news releases usually have one specific \r\n         point to make and everything else supports that one point.  \r\n         Think logically.  Your first paragraph, or the lead to use \r\n         journalistic jargon, should make your point clear.  The \r\n         second paragraph should have more information that supports \r\n         the first, the third should "b'support the second and first, so \r\n         on and so on.  \r\n\r\n              Write simply.  Don\'t use "big" words unless you \r\n         absolutely have to.  They won\'t impress anyone.  You should \r\n         also write short simple sentences.  Long complex sentences \r\n         are harder to read.  Newspapers are written at an eighth \r\n         grade reading level.  Broadcasters have only one chance to \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    'b'     make the listener/viewer understand the story.  If you have \r\n         the media confused you will be ignored.\r\n\r\n              Avoid the use of computer, modem or telecommunications \r\n         jargon.  Jargon that is used should be explained in simple \r\n         terms.  For instance: "GIFs are pictures that can be viewed \r\n         on a computer screen."  That may be oversimplified, but it \r\n         works.\r\n\r\n              One page is usually sufficient for a News Release.  Two \r\n         pages are a'b'cceptable, but more than that is pushing the \r\n         patience of the person you sent it to.  However, if you have \r\n         material to support your News Release, such as a graph or a \r\n         table, include that also.  If they want more information they \r\n         will call you.\r\n\r\n              Even if your News Release does not become recycling \r\n         fodder, it may not be used immediately.  It may be put into a \r\n         file for future use.  \r\n\r\n              The file PR-SAMP.TXT includes sa'b'mple news releases along \r\n         with explanations of how and why they were written.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Public Service Announcements\r\n\r\n              Radio and TV stations devote some programming time to \r\n         Public Service Announcements, or P.S.A.s.  Newspapers may not \r\n         call them that, but they run them as well.  These are a bit \r\n         trickier to write than a News Release mainly because there \r\n         are fairly strict rules concerning what is or is not a PSA.\r\n\r\n      'b'   The litmus tests for a PSA are:\r\n\r\n         1.  Is the group mentioned a profit organization?\r\n\r\n         2.  Is the topic of the PSA controversial?\r\n\r\n         3.  Is the group mentioned controversial?\r\n\r\n         4.  Will the reader/listener/viewer feel they are hearing an \r\n         ad as opposed to a PSA?\r\n\r\n              If the answer to any of those is "yes" that doesn\'t \r\n         necessarily mean it is not a PSA.  Chances are, though, it \r\n         won\'t qualify.\r\n\r\n              PSAs have much i'b'n common with News Releases in that they \r\n         will include Who, What, When, and Where, but might not have a \r\n         Why.  If there is a cost involved, that needs to be included \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         as well.\r\n\r\n              PSAs will normally be sent to the PSA Director at Radio \r\n         and TV stations.  PSAs sent to Newspapers can usually be sent \r\n         to the Editor, who will know which department t'b"o send it to.\r\n\r\n              Many PSAs can be sent on a postcard.  The file PR- \r\n         SAMP.TXT has a sample PSA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               News Conferences\r\n\r\n              My first thought on holding a News Conference is not to \r\n         hold one.  Unless you have something of extreme importance or \r\n         of a compelling nature, a News Conference probably won't be \r\n         necessary.\r\n\r\n              There are only two reasons I can think of for a BBS to \r\n         hold a News Confe"b'rence.  One is when a BBS is launched, but \r\n         even that is of marginal news value. The other is Crisis \r\n         Management.\r\n\r\n              Whichever the case may be, you need to be fully \r\n         prepared.  Have copies of your statement and support \r\n         materials available to distribute to members of the media \r\n         that attend.\r\n\r\n              If I am hesitant to recommend a News Conference, I am \r\n         adamantly against a Sysop holding a question and answer \r\n         session'b' only.  If you have a News Conference, you had better \r\n         have something specific to say or you are going to alienate \r\n         those attending.  \r\n\r\n              Although it is acceptable to read directly from your \r\n         printed statement during your News Conference, you need to \r\n         practice it several times beforehand so you are completely \r\n         familiar with it.  You might even want to practice the entire \r\n         News Conference.  This can be accomplished by having some \r\n   'b'      friends or business associates listen to your statement and \r\n         grill you afterword.  Chances are many of the same questions \r\n         a reporter will ask will be asked by this "practice group."\r\n\r\n              Why do you need to answer questions following your \r\n         statement?  There may be something in your statement that was \r\n         unclear, or maybe needed to be expanded.  Sometimes you might \r\n         even be asked to repeat certain sections.  But when things \r\n         appear t'b"o be slowing down, don't be afraid to call an end to \r\n         the News Conference.  Make yourself available for individual \r\n         interviews following the News Conference.  TV or radio \r\n         stations might want a more intimate sounding discussion of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 13\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         what the News Conference was about instead of the formal \r\n         statement.  A reporter might have a question he/she didn't \r\n         "b"want to ask in a group setting.\r\n\r\n              Your News Conference will be competing with all the \r\n         other news events going on throughout the day.  Don't waste \r\n         time and don't expect everyone invited to attend.  I've found \r\n         early afternoon or mid morning to be the best times to hold \r\n         News Conferences.\r\n\r\n              News Conferences can be a very productive method of \r\n         getting your message across.  But they are also quite \r\n         misused.  Hold a News "b'Conference only if you feel the need is \r\n         absolutely imperative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                             \xb3Handling the Media?\n                             \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n              Timeliness is a very important factor when sending \r\n         material to the media.  \r\n\r\n              Most News Releases that are not dated can be mailed at \r\n         any time.  If they are going to be for release on a specific \r\n         date, they should b'b'e mailed one to two weeks before the date.  \r\n         Public Service Announcements and Event Schedules should be \r\n         sent two to four weeks before the event.\r\n\r\n              This gives the media plenty of time to schedule \r\n         reporters and other resources.\r\n\r\n              I do not recommend calling an Editor or reporter asking \r\n         when your News Release or PSA will be published or aired.  \r\n         They might consider this badgering.  However, you might call \r\n         and ask if th'b"ey received it and had any questions.  That \r\n         doesn't guarantee that it will be used, but it might increase \r\n         its chances, and you might even find out when it would be \r\n         used.\r\n\r\n              The Media is not the enemy.  When you are talking with a \r\n         reporter or a group of reporters there is no need to be \r\n         nervous.  Be friendly but professional.  Treat them as you \r\n         would your co-workers.\r\n\r\n              Generally, be calm but assertive.  You have the"b' \r\n         information they want.  Because computer communications is \r\n         still a burgeoning field, reporters may ask what you think \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 14\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         are dumb or inconsequential questions.  Just answer them \r\n         patiently.  Offer information you think is pertinent to the \r\n         issue.  The more facts they have the more accurate the story \r\n         will be.\r\n\r\n              If you read, see or h'b"ear a news story that you feel was \r\n         unfair in its coverage of the BBS Community, don't be afraid \r\n         to call or write the Editor or News Director and complain \r\n         about it.  Don't be angry, but point out what you feel was \r\n         unfair.  The worst thing you can do is get into an argument \r\n         with a member of the media.  Any headway you've made \r\n         previously can be destroyed.  You are more likely to be \r\n         listened to by being candid but keeping your head on "b"your \r\n         shoulders.  They might make a retraction to the offending \r\n         story or offer you the opportunity to set the record \r\n         straight.  If nothing else, you got it off your chest.\r\n\r\n              Video cameras are so ubiquitous these days that you \r\n         shouldn't give them a second thought.  You should be aware of \r\n         their presence though.  A dark sport jacket with a light \r\n         colored shirt works best on camera.  Flashy or very colorful \r\n         clothes can be "b"very distracting.  The viewer might pay more \r\n         attention to what you are wearing than what you are saying.\r\n\r\n              Never, ever, at any time knowingly tell a falsehood.  \r\n         You'll be caught and you'll be hung out to dry.  If you say \r\n         something that later turns out to be incorrect, then you can \r\n         honestly admit your mistake.  In addition, if there is \r\n         something you don't know, admit that also.  It's always \r\n         better to admit a lack of knowledge th"b'an it is to dance \r\n         around a question with a pseudo-answer.  You can always look \r\n         up the correct answer and call the reporter later.\r\n\r\n              Drawing on that same theme, if you have gotten into a \r\n         situation in which you feel you have gotten in over your \r\n         head, defer the issue to someone you feel comfortable has the \r\n         proper skills and knowledge.  In most cases, a reporter will \r\n         accept your suggested replacement.  The only time it might \r\n    'b'     not work is when the reporter is asking about something that \r\n         directly impacts you or your BBS.  \r\n\r\n              This may seem obvious, but you should return calls \r\n         promptly.  Reporters are always under some sort of deadline \r\n         pressure.  The sooner you can return their calls, the more \r\n         they will appreciate you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 15\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4'b'\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                               \xb3Market Research?\n                               \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n              Who needs to do Market Research?  You do.  The days of \r\n         opening up a BBS with a few file areas and some message bases \r\n         are numbered.  Successful BBSs will be those that plan \r\n         carefully with an eye toward what users really want-- not the \r\n         desires of the noisy few.\r\n\r\n              While online questionnaires are quite useful, they often \r\n         'b"don't go far enough or have a large enough base for you to \r\n         make long term decisions.  The biggest problems are low \r\n         response rates and questions that answer themselves.  Very few \r\n         online surveys that I've seen provide enough qualitative \r\n         information for anything other than short term planning.\r\n\r\n              If you are planning on pulling in some new message \r\n         bases, but want to know which ones will actually be read by \r\n         users, then online questio"b'nnaires are quite sufficient for the \r\n         job.  But if you plan on opening a new BBS, a major change in \r\n         image or thrust, or becoming a larger player in the BBS \r\n         community you probably need to do more than question your \r\n         active users.\r\n\r\n              But there are still times in which you must simply go \r\n         with your visceral instincts.  If you have just done the most \r\n         extensive survey in the history of the industry, you may just \r\n         have to do wh'b"at your gut tells you to do, even if it is in \r\n         total disagreement with what the research says you should do.\r\n\r\n              The easiest, least expensive, and probably the most \r\n         effective research for BBSs to do is call-out research.  Pick \r\n         up the phone and start dialing.  But you must have a method.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Creating a Survey\r\n\r\n              Depending on what you want to find out, you'll want to \r\n         angle your research in different direction"b"s.  A person \r\n         setting up a new BBS is going to need information different \r\n         from that an established Sysop would need to consider whether \r\n         to expand or add services.\r\n\r\n              For our purposes, let's assume you want to do some basic \r\n         research on the group of people that use modems.  To make \r\n         things as easy as possible, we'll assume you will be \r\n         conducting 100 surveys.  This does NOT include people who \r\n         hang up on you or you terminat"b"e because they do not fit the \r\n         demographic profile you are looking for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 16\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              The first thing you'll need to determine is the \r\n         demographic breakdown in your community as a whole.  What is \r\n         the percentage of men and women and their age groups?  This \r\n         information can easily be found at your local library.  Use \r\n         the most recent census data available.  "b"Take those \r\n         percentages in each age/sex demo and conduct the same number \r\n         of surveys (23% women aged 25 to 32 in your community, then \r\n         23 surveys with women in that age group).\r\n\r\n              The first thing you need in the survey is a set of \r\n         Terminal questions.  These questions help you determine the \r\n         age and sex groups you need, whether they own computers, \r\n         whether they own modems and how often they use modems.  If \r\n         they don't answer"b' any of the questions in the appropriate \r\n         manner, you break off the interview.  These people are NOT \r\n         included as part of your 100 completed surveys.\r\n\r\n              If you want an overview of the BBS community compared to \r\n         the community as a whole, you will need to keep track of the \r\n         people that are terminated.\r\n\r\n              Since we are developing a profile on the modem using \r\n         public in your community, we need a set of questions to \r\n         determine'b' how often they use them and in what manner.  We \r\n         then need some questions to find out what services they use, \r\n         what activities they participate in, and what they might see \r\n         as any shortcomings. \r\n\r\n         Finally, some questions on their hardware and software.\r\n\r\n              All these numbers can be inserted into a spreadsheet \r\n         program.  From there you can make pie charts or bar graphs to \r\n         represent just about anything and help you make planning \r\n     'b'    decisions.\r\n\r\n         There is a sample survey in the BBS-SAMP.TXT file.\r\n\r\n              Here are some terms that are in the sample survey that \r\n         you might want to know:\r\n\r\n              PROMPT-- Ask about listed items.  Subject may offer one \r\n         or more.\r\n              QUERY-- Ask for more, do NOT specify.  Ask "Anything \r\n         else?" and write down responses\r\n              (see XX)-- Depending on response to a question, then go \r\n         to the question with that number (eg: see'b" 5B)\r\n              SPECIFY-- Subject may offer an answer.  If not, ask.\r\n              TERMINATE-- Bring to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Making the Call\r\n\r\n              You don't need to buy a list in order to make call out \r\n         research.  All it takes is a phone book or city directory.  \r\n         City directories are helpful in that they will have phone \r\n         numbers and addre"b'sses that may not be in the phone book.  \r\n         City directories are also expensive, especially when compared \r\n         to that phone book you received when you ordered a phone \r\n         line.\r\n\r\n              Starting with the first residential listing, keep \r\n         dialing down the column until you are able to get a completed \r\n         survey.  Skip the rest of that column, next column and start \r\n         at the top of the following.\r\n\r\n              For example, if you have a three column phon'b'e book (most \r\n         are), you get a completed survey on the tenth call in the \r\n         second column.  Skip the remainder of the second column, skip \r\n         the third column, and then start again at the top of the \r\n         first column on the second page.  This will give you a fairly \r\n         random sample.\r\n\r\n              Also make sure you do not purposely call business \r\n         numbers.  Businesses get irritated when people make \r\n         unsolicited calls.  Many individuals do as well. 'b" Expect a \r\n         lot of people to hang up on you.\r\n\r\n              ALWAYS thank the person at the end of the interview, \r\n         even if you terminate them after the first question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n                              \xb3Crisis Management?\n                              \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4?\n\r\n              The first thing to remember about Crisis Management is \r\n         to avoid creating one.  That isn't always possible.  In that \r\n         case, the sec"b'ond thing to remember is "Don\'t Panic."  You \r\n         simply don\'t have time.  Always keep your head.\r\n\r\n              It\'s quite unlikely BBSs will be responsible for \r\n         volcanic eruptions or toxic waste dumps.  Most crisis a BBS \r\n         would be involved in are legal in nature.  If that\'s the \r\n         case, you\'ll need to contact your attorney at once.\r\n\r\n              In fact, you might even want to consider keeping one on \r\n         retainer or having a pre-paid legal plan.  Your attorney'b' \r\n         should be familiar with communications law and First \r\n         Amendment Issues.  Your local Bar Association should be able \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 18\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         to help you find one.\r\n\r\n              The media has easier access to prosecutors than to \r\n         defendants.  That is why in most criminal cases it appears a \r\n         suspect has already been convicted and hauled off even though \r\n         the case has not'b" yet been brought to trial.  The good news is \r\n         that more defense attorneys are becoming media savvy and are \r\n         willing to make statements to reporters.\r\n\r\n              Most of the time, the best thing to do is to let your \r\n         attorney do your talking for you.  Among other things, that's \r\n         what you are paying him for.  He will know what can and \r\n         cannot be said in public and is in a better position to deal \r\n         with legal intricacies that may come up.\r\n\r\n    "b'          For now, the online community tends to rally around BBS \r\n         operators who have been accused of improprieties.  Unless \r\n         your counselor objects, you can begin drumming up support \r\n         from within the industry.  Among other things, you can make \r\n         legal documents available in computer readable form.  Contact \r\n         industry magazines such as BOARDWATCH, BBS CALLERS DIGEST and \r\n         CONNECT and let them know what is happening.  But you should \r\n         always a'b"dvise or consult your attorney before doing any of \r\n         this.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Friendly Faces\r\n\r\n              I've made this point before and I'll make it again.  \r\n         Reporters assigned to cover a story involving BBSs or other \r\n         online services may not fully understand the industry.  Some \r\n         of them may even be technophobes.\r\n\r\n              With that in mind, there is another position you can \r\n         work yourself into.  That is the position of the Loca"b'l \r\n         Expert.  For sake of example, another Sysop has run into \r\n         trouble with the law.  You could make yourself available to \r\n         help explain what some of those complicated technological \r\n         terms are all about, making sure you stay clear of the legal \r\n         issues involved.  You may not get your face on TV or your \r\n         name printed in the paper, but you will be providing a \r\n         valuable service to your local media.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              The First A'b"mendment\r\n                                    at Risk\r\n\r\n              The online community is under attack.  There are many \r\n         in government who apparently believe First Amendment freedoms \r\n         should not be extended to BBSs and other online services, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 19\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         even if they don't explicitly state this.  The Clipper chip \r\n         is just one example.\r\n\r\n              The battle lines are be"b'ing drawn in the courts and in \r\n         the mainstream media.  Solid wins in the justice system will \r\n         help ensure a place for the First Amendment in the future.  \r\n         Diligent and deft manipulation of the media will help ensure \r\n         public support for the online community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                               \xb3Out of the Box?\n                               \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n              Many Sysops set up a BBS in a cloistered room'b', hunch \r\n         over a brightly lit screen late at night tweaking here and \r\n         tweaking there.  "Heh!" they think, "this new door game will \r\n         bring me a few more callers!"\r\n\r\n              Wrong.\r\n\r\n              You can be assured that new game is A) already on \r\n         another BBS in town, B) the potential new callers won\'t know \r\n         for sometime that you have it or C) potential new callers \r\n         won\'t care that you have it.\r\n\r\n              The game can wait \'til tomorrow.'b"  Do something that is \r\n         more likely to bring in potential callers to your BBS in \r\n         particular and into the BBS community generally.  Get out of \r\n         the house.\r\n\r\n              Chances are your BBS or the local BBS or Sysops' \r\n         Association sponsors a picnic or some such at least once a \r\n         year.  Although this is a good idea, it usually is a \r\n         gathering a modem users.  You need to become more involved \r\n         with the community as a whole.\r\n\r\n            "b'  There are many, many opportunities to create a good \r\n         public relations image within the community.  Even though the \r\n         mainstream media should be a part of your public relations \r\n         efforts, you do not have to rely on them to tell your \r\n         message.\r\n\r\n              Your local Chamber of Commerce probably has some sort of \r\n         monthly or annual list of events going on in the community.  \r\n         There should be several that you can attend or co-sponsor on \r\n         b'b"ehalf of the BBS.  You can also make yourself available to \r\n         talk to Service Clubs and Youth Groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          BBS-PR pg 20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Have you thought of conducting a seminar?  Let's face \r\n         it, BBSs are not among the easiest computer applications to \r\n         use.  You could teach users and potential users about \r\n         telecommunications and BBSing.  With more and more BBSs \r\n         connecting to t"b'he Internet, a seminar on how to use the \r\n         Internet could be quite valuable.  As an aside, you might \r\n         even be able to bring in a few bucks by conducting seminars.\r\n\r\n              Schools are another place to make your mark.  Donate \r\n         your time to teach a class or be a guest in a class.  You \r\n         might even consider donating your old equipment to an \r\n         elementary school when you upgrade to newer equipment.  That \r\n         might even bring you some good press covera'b"ge.\r\n\r\n              If you have a laptop or an older computer you wouldn't \r\n         mind toting around, take it with you with a scaled down \r\n         version of your BBS to show people what it looks like.  Very \r\n         few things work better than a good visual aid.  \r\n\r\n              If you produce a newsletter for your BBS that is mailed \r\n         to users on a regular basis, add the local media outlets to \r\n         your mailing list.  Just as with News Releases, most \r\n         newsletters will b"b"e thrown out.  But sometimes someone will \r\n         grab an idea from one and produce a story from it.  By golly, \r\n         you'll probably be the first person they call.\r\n\r\n              Everyday thousands of cars go past yours or you pass \r\n         them.  Bumper stickers are moving billboards.  Make them \r\n         available anytime you are out meeting the public.  Because \r\n         you must make a quick impression, just have the name of your \r\n         BBS and the data phone number printed on them.\r\n"b'\r\n              Coffee mugs and t-shirts are good promotional items that \r\n         can also bring in some money.

The Internet is a worldwide \r\n         network connecting Universities, Research Centers, Government \r\n         and Business with electronic mail, news, public message \r\n         bases, and computer programs.\r\n\r\n              This is the first time the Internet has been publicly \r\n        'b' available in the Fort Smith area.

Now users in Fort Smith can \r\n         easily share information with the world and gather \r\n         information from sources they couldn\'t reach before."\r\n\r\n              Aphelion BBS will provide a free Electronic Mailbox to \r\n         anyone wishing to receive private messages.

The Internet is, if not the largest, one the \r\n         largest computer oceans.\r\n\r\n              Aphelion Computer Bulletin Board System is sponsoring a \r\n         seminar designed to help computer users learn to navigate \r\n         through the Internet.  "This seminar will focus on Electronic \r\n         mail addressing and file transfers," according to System \r\n         Operator Robert Parson.

The \r\n         charge for the seminar was included since it was necessary, \r\n         but it was b'b"uried deep in the news release.\r\n\r\n              If you'll notice, both of these news releases have a \r\n         contact name and number.

Whether you \r\n         have a 32 line commercial BBS, a single line hobby board or \r\n         somewhere in between, you are selling a service.  'b'Just as \r\n         with any other product, you have to decide where and how your \r\n         public relations efforts should best be spent.  \r\n\r\n              Now may be a good time to look at your BBS and take an \r\n         inventory.  The Inventory included at the beginning of this \r\n         file will help you take stock of the strengths and weaknesses \r\n         of your BBS.  Some of these things you may already have \r\n         thought of.  Others possibly not.  Whatever the case may be, \r\n         this 'b'is a very subjective matter and there are no right or \r\n         wrong answers.\r\n\r\n              We\'ll take this step by step and briefly examine some of \r\n         the immediate public relations problems your BBS may present \r\n         and some ways to solve those problems.\r\n\r\n              I want you to bear in mind that it is NOT my intention \r\n         to tell you how to run your BBS.  In addition, I don\'t think \r\n         there are any "bad" features for a BBS, except of course \r\n         those that ar'b'e patently illegal.  If anything like that is \r\n         implied, it wasn\'t intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n         BBS NAME:\r\n\r\n              The name of your BBS should be chosen very carefully and \r\n         it should be in keeping with the overall tone of the BBS.  \r\n         Chances are you wouldn\'t want to call your BBS "Thunder of \r\n         Cloven Hooves" if the emphasis is on scholarly Biblical \r\n         discussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Sysop:\r\n\r\n              If you are known to users mainly as the Sysop, that \r\n     'b"    could be creating an aloof image.  That could be the image \r\n         you want.  On some larger boards with staffs that may be the \r\n         best way to handle administrative duties.  But if you want to \r\n         have a more folksy and personable board you need to make \r\n         yourself known.  Create an account with your name, if you \r\n         haven't already done so.  Encourage users to refer to you \r\n         with your name, instead of The Sysop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  "b'                  YOUR PRODUCT pg 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    General Interest/Special Focus\r\n\r\n              You may want to have a BBS with a little bit of \r\n         everything for everybody.  Even with cable becoming more \r\n         prevalent, the three major broadcast networks still have the \r\n         largest viewership.  A General Interest BBS with a very large \r\n         plate to offer will draw users but could overwhelm some \r\n         users, especially new users.  \r\n\r\n              'b"A BBS with a specific interest runs the risk of being \r\n         too narrowly defined.  There is probably a market for a BBS \r\n         about horse racing jockeys six feet and taller with green \r\n         eyes, but it's also so specialized it would attract few \r\n         callers (if any).\r\n\r\n\r\n         Users\r\n\r\n              Most BBS have very large user lists.  Many of those \r\n         lists are bogus in that they reflect all the people that have \r\n         visited since the BBS was established.  Some Syso"b"ps routinely \r\n         clean the chaff out of the user lists.  This is a good idea \r\n         in that it makes it easier for Sysops to keep track of who is \r\n         active and who is not.  In addition it helps users who log in \r\n         only occasionally.  If a user hasn't logged on recently he \r\n         has usually lost track of what happened the last time he was \r\n         on.  It reminds occasional users that it might be a good idea \r\n         to stop in more often.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Money:\r\n\r\n         "b"     As I'm sure you are aware, a Bulletin Board can cost a \r\n         lot to operate.  The trend is to charge some kind of \r\n         subscription.  There are a number of different ways in which \r\n         to do this.  A very large portion of the BBS community \r\n         believes that charging for access violates the spirit of \r\n         freedom of information that has been intertwined with \r\n         personal computers since their introduction.  You will face \r\n         that sort of resistance, especially"b' if your BBS has had a \r\n         history of access at no charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n         FILES:\r\n\r\n              File areas are arguably the heart of a BBS.  And just as \r\n         with a human heart, they can create a huge amount of trouble \r\n         if not properly taken care of.    \r\n\r\n              File Requests can be a valuable promotional tool.  Many \r\n         software companies allow potential buyers to request a demo \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     YOUR PRODUCT pg 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r'b"\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         from their support board to try the software before \r\n         purchasing it.  Some BBSs allow downloads of certain \r\n         informational files without having the caller registered or \r\n         verified.  This is potentially a very powerful feature and \r\n         probably should be implemented on your BBS if it isn't \r\n         already.  A file explaining your policies, the message bases \r\n         available, some hints on how to use your BBS (especially if \r\n         it uses a les"b's well known software package), and maybe even a \r\n         registration or subscription form.  This gives the user an \r\n         idea of what your BBS is like and can leave him with a good \r\n         feeling in that he received something without having full \r\n         access.\r\n\r\n              BBSs are commonly cited as a major source of computer \r\n         viruses.  If you take great pains to check all files for \r\n         viruses before making them publicly available then you can \r\n         put many users'b"' minds at ease.  Make sure you promote that \r\n         often on your BBS and in any advertising you do.  Sometimes a \r\n         virus will sneak through even the best virus checkers.  Track \r\n         down the offending file, delete it and apologize to those who \r\n         downloaded it.  But gently remind users that you are not \r\n         responsible for damage caused by the virus.  They downloaded \r\n         and used it at their own risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Message Bases:\r\n\r\n              If File Areas are th"b'e heart of a BBS, then the Message \r\n         Bases are the soul of your BBS.  That is where your users \r\n         have the biggest opportunity to contribute to the board.  \r\n         This is also where you have the biggest opportunity to set \r\n         the image of the BBS.  Your message bases can be wide and \r\n         varied or narrow and focused on just a few topics.  Keep in \r\n         mind not everyone is going to be tactful and considerate.  \r\n         Some are rude and downright mean.\r\n\r\n           'b"   Nationally echoed message bases can be a valuable asset \r\n         to your board.  But there will be times when there are \r\n         matters of interest in Waxahachie, Texas that folks in Erie, \r\n         Pennsylvania won't be interested in.  Chances are you have at \r\n         least one message base that is specific for local matters.  \r\n         You may want to consider opening up a few others depending on \r\n         the demand from your users.     \r\n\r\n\r\n         DOORS:\r\n\r\n              Your choice of D"b"oor programs create a twofold public \r\n         relations challenge right out of the box.  First, there may \r\n         be times in which you add a door that doesn't quite fit the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     YOUR PRODUCT pg 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         image you are trying to create on your BBS.  In that case \r\n         it's a fairly simple matter to remove the door program.  \r\n         Second, a very popular door could tie up your BBS for hours a \r\n         day with j"b'ust a few users, causing frustration to others.  \r\n         This is particularly true of games.  \r\n\r\n\r\n         MISC:\r\n\r\n              Most BBSs run a screen full of Bulletins when the user \r\n         logs on.  These bulletins should be updated as often as \r\n         possible.  Callers need to know what\'s going on with your \r\n         BBS, even if it\'s just the latest scores for "Red Dragon."  \r\n         Most users don\'t read the bulletins on a regular basis.  But, \r\n         they leave the impression that 'b'you have a "happening" BBS.  A \r\n         business owner I once worked for said to me "The impression \r\n         that we have business generates business."  He always made \r\n         sure there were cars in front of his business, even if they \r\n         belonged to employees.  Your bulletins can be the cars in \r\n         front of your business.  \r\n\r\n              Curiously, though, a lot of bulletins can also turn away \r\n         a user.  If you have a potload of bulletins, you might want \r\n         to thin'b'k about moving some to areas in which they are more \r\n         appropriate.  Bulletins of game scores might be moved to a \r\n         gaming conference, as an example.  Rules, policies and news \r\n         should be the primary considerations when developing log on \r\n         bulletins.  \r\n\r\n              There are several BBS and Sysop groups and associations \r\n         that you can become a member of.  There might even be one or \r\n         more in your area.  They are sources of support, solutions, \r\n      'b'   and other information.  If you are having trouble with \r\n         another sysop, the association can be a place to arbitrate \r\n         your difficulties.  If worse comes to worse and you run afoul \r\n         of the law as a result of your BBS, the group may be able to \r\n         put you in touch with some legal help.\r\n\r\n              A meeting can also provide you with the opportunity to \r\n         unwind after a hard day of slaving over a hot keyboard.  I \r\n         strongly recommend joining a group.\r'b"\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     YOUR PRODUCT pg 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                                \xb3GOAL SETTING?\n                                \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n\r\n              Even if you don't run a commercial BBS, you should think \r\n         of it as a business.  There is hardly any business that does \r\n         not take an inventory on a regular basis.   Any business that \r\n         does not analyze "b"itself occasionally is doomed to failure.\r\n\r\n              Every six months or so, sit back and look at where your \r\n         BBS has been, where it's at and where it's going.  Do you \r\n         have specific goals in mind?  What are you doing to meet \r\n         those goals?  How is your Public Relations campaign \r\n         reflecting the climb toward those goals?\r\n\r\n              Whatever you are up to, PROMOTE, PROMOTE, PROMOTE.  Tell \r\n         your users what's going on.  Tell your co-workers.  Tell the"b' \r\n         dog.  Get the word out on the street somehow.  \r\n\r\n              This is only a cursory look at some the things you \r\n         should be aware of from a public relations standpoint as you \r\n         examine your BBS.  You might want to do things differently.  \r\n         Public relations is an art, and you may prefer to do yours in \r\n         oil while I prefer chalk.\r\n\r\n              I encourage you to write me and let me know what your \r\n         are doing in the area of Public Relations.\r\n\r\n  'b'       Robert Parson\r\n         2501 Phoenix\r\n         Fort Smith, AR 72901\r\n         501 646 9332 (voice)\r\n         Paradox of Arkansas BBS 501 484 0944/501 484 1043\r\n         (Fred Ayers, Sysop)\r\n         Jackalope Junction BBS 501 785 5381 (Steve Prado, Sysop)\r\n         internet   r.parson@genie.geis.com\r\n         GEnie      R.Parson\r\n         Fido       1:3822/1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     YOUR PRODUCT pg 5\r\n\r\n\r\n::::::::::::::\npr-rates.txt\n:::::::'b':::::::\n                            \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                            \xb3BBS Public Relations?\n                            ?Aphelion Promotions?\n                            \xc0\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xd9\r\n\r\n                                 Robert Parson\r\n                                 2501 Phoenix\r\n                             Fort Smith, AR 72901\r\n                             501 646 9332 (voice)\r\n\r\n                                  Support BBS\r\n                    Paradox of Arkansas (Fred Ayers'b', Sysop)\r\n                           501 484 0944/501 484 1043\r\n                    Jackalope Junction (Steve Prado, Sysop)\r\n                                 501 785 5381\r\n\r\n                       Internet r.parson@genie.geis.com\r\n                                 Fido 1:3822/1\r\n\r\n                                \xda\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xc4\xbf\r\n                                ?

It is designed to help Sysops create a Public \r\n         Image outside of the BBS community.  I have tried to jam as \r\n         much solid information about Public Relations into as small a \r\n         package as possible.  \r\n\r\n              There is no intent to tell Sysops how a BBS should be \r\n         run.  If that is implied at any point, I apologize in \r\n         advance.  \r\n\r\n              All files in this gui'b'de are (c) 1993 and 1994 Robert \r\n         Parson.

Because of this, I had to split the primary BBS-PR\r\n         (which ran into 64K printer buffer problems) file into two \r\n         smaller files.
